In the current environment no one actually believes leadership cares for anything other than their careers.

Leaders continually ride those they are suppose to lead like mules then kick them aside and move up the ladder.\r\nCP - The next accident could happen in CENTCOM and will be linked with complacency and fatigue.

Standardization in procedures from taxi to shutdown also cut down of questions of intent.\r\nCP - Overzealous attempts at fuel conservation.

The AF cares less about being good aviators than making new leaders.  The AF doesn't care if you have a Q3 for advancing in the ranks but if SOS is not complete or a masters degree is not accomplished the member will not be promoted and likely released as an O4 at 16 years of service.  \r\nThis is an institutional problem and has become a fundamental concern for safety.\r\nSuggestion:  Cancel the requirement for AADs, have squadrons re-assess additional duties and if they are not mandatory get rid of them.  Do not make it a requirement to do PME in correspondence  then in residence. Get rid of as many staff jobs as possible  and put the focus back into the cockpit.\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nCP - Crew fatigue is my #1 concern regarding  flight safety.  Constant scheduling of min ground times and off-circadian rhythm flying is taking a serious toll on a young and relatively inexperienced crew force.

TACC planners seem more focused on pleasing outside organizations - and AMC always yields to others' requirements - than on the care of their own people.\r\nThis isn't FedEx, this is a military organization; we must reduce some of the focus on \"customer service\" and return to a military leadership mindset of taking care of people.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************************\r\nFE - Fatigue from min ground time and constant off-cycle circadian rhythms.

the flight called for low ceilings and poor visibility for the following day at the arrival base.  The crew elected to request a 35k fuel load and conveyed this to MX.  However, on arrival the following day, during the initial brief it was determined that the jet was only fueled to 30k.  After a thorough weather review it was decided that a 35k fuel load was still required and MX was again directed to fuel the jet to a 35k, which they did.\r\nDuring preflight the AC identified that the Standby ADI was inop.  At about the same time the CP identified that the weight and balance computation was in error.  This prompted a long discussion between the two Ibs and the CP regarding fuel density and manual vs automated weight and balance calculations.  This took place while trouble shooting the previous threat presented by the Standby ADI.  During preflight the aircrew became distracted by a Standby ADI malfunction and a weight and balance error that coincided at the same time.  After both issues had been resolved they did not reenter the checklist where they had left off, skipping the entire flight control check. The Bos eventually figured out the discrepancy and the correct weight and balance was entered in the FSAS.  However, the crew had become channelized on both the Standby ADI malfunction and a weight and balance discrepancy.  This led them to skip directly to the autopilot checklist steps, missing several other checklist items.  During the out of sequence autopilot check the pitch axis would not engage.  After the initial trouble shooting the AC noticed low rudder pressure and that the rudder power switch was in the still in the OFF position.  He directed the CP to review the checklist and begin where they had left off before the Standby ADI and Weight and balance issues.  The crew then correctly reentered the checklist where they had left off and continued the preflight.

It was this communication and back up that assisted the crew in, what for them, was a nonstandard mission: C2 coordination, light weight, cold weather, and unfamiliar airfields.  Special emphasis should be given to the third pilot, who was actively involved with: the initial brief and the incorrect fuel issue, the preflight MX trouble shooting, and the approach and landing brief.\r\nThis crew communication helped to address the procedural errors in the preflight checklist and the approach briefing.

ACFT deiced prior to crew show.  Wings were deiced with flaps up instead of down. AC briefed crew chiefs (CC) on EPs and mission timing.  AC accomplished external inspection.  During AC walk around, flaps were never extended for inspection.  After flaps were extended later in the preflight, the AC never went out to inspect them. CP performed interior inspection.  CP determined DAFIF was out of date and required loading.  While running the DAFIF loading checklist, CP couldn't determine if the PCMCIA card she loaded during mission planning contained valid DAFIF.  CP realized the card was initially loaded improperly and there was no DAFIF on the card.  AC helped trouble shoot the problem.  AC turned this event into an instructional point and taught the CP how to load DAFIF to the card with the laptop and how to verify the data on the card during the preflight.  DAFIF loading did not cause a delay to mission timing.  The remainder of the preflight was accomplished per tech order.  Engine start checklist started 28 minutes prior to takeoff.

KMCF is a local AR mission in support of Naval JTFEX.  The missions are planned on board the carrier where the tanker squadron has an embedded pilot.  That embed communicates with KMCF CP to transfer classified mission details to the aircrews.  They are long missions over the weekend which leads to less support and less enthusiasm to prepare beforehand. \r\n\r\nThe AC did not consider the planning products to be effective due to their size and depth.  The AC was 5-10min late to showtime which is 3:15 prior to takeoff. \r\n\r\nDuring mission planning, the FM200 flight plan was utilized by the crew for fuel planning.  This form did not have the correct 3% fuel degrade for drogue sorties making it inaccurate by approximately 3500lbs.\r\nThe crew did not detect the discrepancy in their mission planning products.  Other mission changes (canx receivers, shorter onstation time) led to them having more fuel and the outcome was inconsequential.\r\n\r\nDuring mission planning, the AC was unable to log into GDSS2 to download the IFM package.  The mission planning products were provided by local planners, but the IFM contains TACC weather.\r\nThe AC directed the BO to log in and download.  The event compressed their timeline by 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nDuring mission planning, the CP attempted to copy the latest ePubs to an external harddrive that are used as IPAD backups. The 2 computers dedicated to this task in mission planning were inoperative.\r\nThe CP directed the BO to utilize a different room's computer to accomplish. Their timeline was further compressed approximately 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nDuring mission planning, the crew had difficulty accessing the materials because it was kept in command post classified storage. The mission planner on board the USS Truman provided the crew with large amounts of data including SPINS, callsign changes, comm plans, and textual description of the ATO (but not the actual ATO). These materials were available the day prior; they are unorganized and a lot of useless data.\r\nThe crew obtained these materials 20 minutes after showtime and delayed their processing of it until other admin (G2, epubs) was accomplished. This led to a late brief and late step. (Marginal Plans Stated / Poor Evaluation of  Plans)\r\n\r\nDuring mission planning, the AC was unable to begin and end his brief at the appropriate time. This was due to processing of large amounts of disorganized data and various technical issues that compressed their timeline.\r\nThe CP did not aid in time management at all and the crew stepped 10 minutes late. (Marginal SOP Briefing)\r\n\r\nPreflight\r\nAfter the 10 minute late step, the crew showed no signs of being in a hurry or doing their tasks with any sense of urgency.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight, the AC discovered that MX had left the circuit breaker panel with multiple popped CBs.  APU, IPC, HF, Anti-ice, etc were popped with no associated writeups.  Additionally, the parking break was left engaged.\r\nThe AC called the crew chiefs into the aircraft to query them on the status of the panel. Unable to explain, they pushed all CBs back in and the AC continued his preflight.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight, the CP discovered the navigation and refueling database was expired.\r\nThe CP began loading the databases which delayed his checklist for approximately 8 minutes.  The new databases are concurrent with FLIP and this should have been anticipated.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight, the crew chief was required to interrupt and delay the checklist during the Control and Trim check.  He repeatedly disconnected his headset because his comm cord was too short.\r\nThe crew was obliged to wait for the crew chief to check back on and report the status of the controls (especially the boom poppet valve).\r\n\r\nDuring preflight and immediately prior to engine start, the AC elected to start the Starting Engines/Before Taxi checklist before the Interior Inspection checklist was complete. They still had W&B and Seats and Harnesses to complete.\r\nThe crew did not object to starting the APUs because it saved time.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight and immediately prior to engine start, the AC called the BO to close the cargo compartment door and report ready for engine start. The BO was not on headset.  This issue occurred again after engine start and before taxi; the AC wanted to taxi, but the BO was off headset to report ready.\r\nThe AC was obliged to delay engine start for 2 minutes until the boom closed the door and got on headset. The AC was obliged to delay taxi for 1 minute until the BO reported ready for taxi.\r\n\r\nEngine Start/Taxi\r\n\r\nDuring engine start, the CP stopped monitoring the engine spool-up during a critical time to review future checklist steps.\r\nThe AC was monitoring the engines and therefore, did not notice the CP distraction.  The engines started properly.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight, the CP miscalculated TOLD by not accounting for the drogue and not running the KC-135 Departure Planning Guide correctly (specifically, the 300'/NM OEI step). \r\nThe AC never verified the TOLD and therefore, the error was not detected.  The aircraft took off with the data as run.\r\n\r\nDuring preflight, the AC failed to cross verify the TOLD.  The CP had incorrectly calculated it with regards to the drogue and the ft/nm requirement.  The aircraft took off with the incorrect TOLD putting the aircraft in a climb profile that was not valid per the KC-135 Dept Planning Guide. \t\r\nThe crew did not detect the incorrect TOLD or the missed verification.  The climb was 4 engine and therefore, the potential lack of performance was not realized. (Poor Monitor/Crosscheck)\r\n\r\nDuring taxi, the AC and CP did not have an airfield diagram, charts, or approach plates in view.\r\nThe crew was familiar with the local field and the weather was VFR.  Additionally, they had the Pharoeh app on their iPad if necessary.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartSopBriefing","value":"Marginal","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartPlansStated","value":"Marginal","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartContingencyManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Poor","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartWorkloadManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartRunwayManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Poor","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartInquiry","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbInquiry","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Marginal","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbNarrative","value":"Takeoff/Climb\r\n\r\nThe takeoff was 10 minutes late, which is within TACC tolerances.\r\nThe departure from KMCF into Tampa airspace is congested.

The heavyweight aircraft began to accelerate rapidly and exceeded 230KIAS before the CP was able to verify the Flaps are Up and the Rudder in the Low Range.\r\nThe AC detected the lack of cross verification at 246KIAS and verified the flaps were up/rudder power in low range.

They discovered more questions than answers in the pile of detail papers.\r\n\r\nDuring TOC to rendezvous and entry to the W122 refueling area at 21000, the ATC/GCI controller queried the aircraft for event number, ATO mode 2, and delay time.\r\nThe crew sought for these items within their mission papers but did not have the answers to any of these questions. The controller simply directed them to proceed.\r\n\r\nDuring the TOC to rendezvous at 21000, the AC was attempting to determine the location of the aircraft carrier by entering the TACAN frequency in and setting the receiver to A/A REC instead of TR.\r\nNeither pilot realized their error and determined that the carrier's TACAN was inop. They did not end up requiring the carrier location for their orbit.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire flight or at level off at 34000, the AC and CP did not accomplish any system checks on HEFOE (hydraulic, electrics, fuel, ox, engines).\r\nNeither crew member detected the lack of systems checks and the systems operated normally throughout the flight.\r\n\r\nDuring Prep for AR at 2100, the TCAS announced a TA at 12oclock, 5nm, 400ft below. The traffic had been on the screen for 20nm.\r\nThe crew began to clear visually and saw the fighter aircraft at 4NM.

aircraft MX problems.  UHF 1 Radio needed 30 minutes of warmup to operate. Auto-Throttle system 2 was INOP. The lower beacon light was INOP/circuit breaker popped. The forward and aft Lavatories were not serviced.  The FE methodically worked the issues with MX and consulted the MEL (Minimum Equipment List).  After thorough consultation with MX and the AC, it was decided that the aircraft was suitable for one flight back to KWRI for MX.  Space available passengers were transferred to another KC-10 departing at the same time enroute to KWRI because the Lavatory situation was unacceptable for passengers.  \r\nDuring mission planning at Base operations, the winded flight plan indicated that arrival at KWRI would occur during the BASH (Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard) window which is plus or minus one hour of sunset. This would necessitate holding and additional fuel upload.  The pilots discussed options and determined that slipping the takeoff time 10 minutes was the best option.  This short delay would allow the aircraft to arrive as the BASH window was ending and still meet an operationally on time takeoff (less than +14 minutes).  The crew slipped normal preflight pacing ten minutes.\r\nDuring the preflight, the CP contacted Clearance Delivery for the departure clearance.  Clearance Delivery was unable to give the clearance due to workload.  The crew continued performing preflight duties.  During the Before Start Checklist, clearance delivery called back interrupting the checklist accomplishment.  The AC told the FE to hold the checklist and then directed the CP to get the departure clearance.  The FE did a nice job of ensuring all items of the checklist were accomplished after dealing with clearance delivery.\r\nClearance delivery issued a challenging verbal clearance that differed from the SID and included a frequency that was unavailable to the crew.  The verbal clearance was, \"Callsign you are cleared to KWRI via radar vectors to BLD then direct Dove Creek (no identifier issued). On departure turn right heading 300, remain at or below 3,000 until the departure end, climb and maintain FL210, expect FL410 in 10 minutes, contact departure on local button 5, squawk 7714.  On departure remain North of the LSV 7.5 DME arc. This departure requires a climb gradient of 300 ft per nm to 12,000 ft.\"  The CP required three clarifications to make sure all restrictions were understood and the departure frequency was clarified because \"local button 5\" was not meaningful to this KWRI crew.  The AC, CP, and FE worked together well to make sure all restrictions were understood.  The FE was consulted to make sure the climb gradient would be met.  The AC (PF) did a very nice job during the Takeoff Briefing addressing the challenging clearance and engine out SDP addressing NAVAID settings and Flight Guidance procedure/technique to comply with the clearance. (OUTSTANDING PLANS STATED)\r\nPrior to starting engines, the FE made an error running the Before Takeoff Checklist.  He called for \"CDUs\" rather than \"CDUs/EHSIs/Radio Aids\".  The CP (PNF) immediately queried \"CDUs, EHSIs, and Radio Aids?\"  The FE realized his error and correctly read the full step without error.  The checklist continued without further error or omission.  \r\nDuring Taxi, tower asked if the crew could accept an intersection takeoff in order to de-conflict with fighter aircraft arming at the hammerhead.  The TOLD was for a full runway length and the crew did not have intersection takeoff data.  The AC (FP) quickly decided that he preferred the full length even if that would delay our departure.  This was the safest course of action.  Tower issued clearance to taxi and and hold behind the fighters.  The intersection takeoff threat was negated simply by refusing the offer.\r\nApproaching the planned departure runway, RWY 21R, tower instructed to cross 21R and hold short of RWY 21L.  This runway change required addressing TOLD and the engine out SDP further delaying takeoff.  The AC (PF) did a nice job delegating duties and directing the CP (PNF) communicating with tower.  He had the FE run new TOLD.  He had the instructor FE check the new TOLD and the CP (PNF) check CFL (Critical Field Length) to comply with SOPs.  This methodical approach was the correct and safe response despite pressure from tower asking if we were \"ready for departure\". (OUTSTANDING WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT)\r\nAfter being cleared by tower \"lineup and wait RWY 21L\", tower asked if we could pull further down the runway in order to let a KC-135 cross the runway behind us.  This would have negated our TOLD for a third time.  The TOLD is specific for 300 ft lineup distance.  The entire crew immediately realized the implication on TOLD.  The AC queried tower and the KC-135 if there was enough taxi room without us pulling forward.  The crew was not going to \"change runways/TOLD\" a third time!  A tower supervisor stepped in and stopped the discussion by instructing us to remain in position and expect departure shortly. \r\nThis crew successfully addressed seven Threats prior to takeoff!\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartPlansStated","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartContingencyManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartWorkloadManagement","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartRunwayManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartInquiry","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbInquiry","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbNarrative","value":"During takeoff roll at approximately 100 knots, a wire bundle associated with AC (PF) Flight Instrument Lighting swung down from the Pilot's glareshield into view in front of the AC's (PF) primary flight instruments.  This presented a serious distraction and threat as the AC (PF) had to make a judgment about what the disconnected wire bundle was and what effect it might have on the aircraft.  The AC (PF) decided to continue the takeoff.  The disconnected wire bundle had no operational effect because A/T system two was previously worked by MX and rendered INOP.  The wire bundle was not properly secured out of view.  The experienced AC (PF) quickly analyzed the situation and correctly decided to continue the takeoff.\r\nThe challenging departure was well flown by the experienced AC (PF).  All restrictions were met due to a thorough takeoff/departure briefing and addressing required NAVAIDs and Flight Guidance duties for the CP (PNF). \r\nWhile climbing to FL 210, the CP (PNF) omitted the altitude level-off callout.  The AC (PF) made the call \"FL200 for FL210\", the CP (PNF) acknowledged the error and parroted the call.

He switched the frequency to KWRI KC-10 Formation interplane frequency 139.875.  This is a procedural error because 11-2KC-10 Vol 3 requires the crew to monitor UHF and VHF Guard Emergency frequency at all times except during Formation or Air Refueling when other procedures apply.   The fact that the radio was on the improper frequency should have been subsequently noted when music was noticed on the interplane frequency and the AC (PF) talked to another KC-10 that was nearby flying from KLSV - KWRI.  The two aircraft did not brief or fly as a formation.  It appeared to me that the  experienced AC (PF) intentionally set the interplane frequency on the chance that the other aircraft would \"want to chat\".  It is unknown if the less experienced CP's (PNF) and FE's failure to correct the error was intentional or a result of ignorance of the requirement to monitor Guard Emergency frequency.  The error was not noted at the time of frequency change by either the CP (PNF) or FE.  No adverse outcome resulted.\r\nOverall, the AC (PF) did an excellent job orchestrating the cruise portion of the flight.  The crew referred to Enroute charts to maintain situational awareness.

The AC (PF) told the FE to monitor ATIS frequency and report when he had the information.  The FE obtained ATIS during the initial descent from cruise altitude.

base and conducted excellent communication with each other about what their plan was for the day.  All crew members made a great effort to work together to get the aircraft ready to fly.\r\nThe CP did not check that he had the right bag in ATOC and so did not know that he had the wrong classified material secrets.\r\nWhen the AC arrived at the aircraft from flight planning in ATOC the FE informed him that there was a problem with the wing air refueling pod (WARP) on one of the wings.  As part of the normal preflight of the system, pressurizing it caused the blue \"DROUGUE DEPLOYED\" light and the amber \"DROUGUE NOT STOWED\" lights to illuminate on the FE panel.\r\nThe AC quickly assessed the situation and asked for more information from the crew chief, and FE.  He wanted to know if the wing drogue was actually still out, or if it was just the light.  The crew chief and FE informed him that it was just the light, it appeared fully stowed.  \r\nThe AC shared with the crew that as this was a positioning leg, and they didn't need to use the drogue until the next active leg and that he was inclined to fly with it to OMAM where it had a good chance of being fixed.  He also stated that they would need to research the MEL for guidance if they couldn't get it fixed themselves but that was in fact the goal, to somehow get the light to go out.  (Outstanding Plans Stated) The crew chief suggested that he could try to wind it in with the help of the boom operator.  In fact, they eventually had to trail it slightly then reel it in and they were ultimately able to retract it and get both lights to go out.  It was inconsequential. \r\nNo ATIS was available at LICZ for the crew to use for preflight operations like planning which runway to use for takeoff, and for the current altimeter.  When they got to altimeter in the preflight scan the pilots had to ask the FE if he had acquired the ATIS and he told them no he had not.  This interrupted their flow of the preflight scan as they had to call ground first and got no answer and so had to call tower to get the current weather and active runway.\r\nThe aircraft commander, in the left seat and so leading the pre-flight scan, stated before he started making the radio calls that they needed to pick up the preflight where they left off, as an excellent technique he placed a pen across the bottom 2 dials of the altimeter, the baroset knob and the minimums set knob. He stated that this out of place item would be noticed by him and remind him to pick up the scan where he was interrupting it to get the ATIS info from ATC. After he wrote the info down with a different pen he picked the pen off the altimeter and continued the scan perfectly where he had left off without missing any items.\r\nDuring preflight the boom operator interrupted the middle of the loading of the waypoints by bringing up the form F and verbally telling the pilot he had the form F and holding it out in front of the AC until he took it.\r\nThe AC looked a little annoyed and stopped loading the waypoints with the CP. He checked the form F and handed it back to the boom operator. The CP patiently waited for the AC to finish checking the form F. When the AC was done, he asked the CP where they were in the loading and the CP remembered. The pilots continued to load the rest of the flight plan waypoints with no mistakes.\r\nMuch earlier, during, pre-flight planning in ATOC, the ATOC personnel gave the CP the wrong classified secrets bag.\r\nThe CP did not check that he had the right bag in ATOC and so did not know that he had the wrong classified material secrets. Out at the aircraft he attempted to load the Mode 4 but the device had dumped all the codes. As he trouble shot this issue by going through the bag he identified that he had the wrong bag.\r\nHe informed the AC that he had the wrong classified material, and the AC said to call a bus and go back in to ATOC and get the correct bag. The CP went back in, and got the right bag, but this took significant time.  He could have definitely walked back in faster and accomplished the swap out for the correct bag more quickly but at LICZ you are not permitted to walk on the ramp to ATOC. The whole process of waiting for the bus, and rectifying the wrong secrets bag took 25 minutes because of waiting on a bus.  The CP appeared stressed and frustrated with himself for the error and after rushing back, and loading the mode 4, he had a whole 30 seconds to mentally prepare to close up and start checklists towards getting the aircraft toward the runway for takeoff.\r\nDuring the call for clearance, clearance delivery gave clearance for the Ernam 1 tango departure which does not exist in the current DOD FLIP and was not in the NOTAMS or TCN.\r\nThe CP was having trouble understanding the radios anyway, but after he was helped by the FE and AC to understand what was being said, and then read it back, the AC, and FE realized that they did not have the SID.  The CP tried to communicate this fact to clearance delivery which was also ground, and ground got confused, somehow thinking that engines had been started already, and that the CP was calling to ask to taxi to the runway.  \r\nGround control gave them clearance to taxi to runway 28 L which was the recip of the runway they had previously been given (10 R) when they had called for altimeter and active runway earlier in the pre-flight.  The FE was all of a sudden worried now about takeoff data, which the AC acknowledged, but stated that they would fix that next what he was concerned about was being given the Ernam 1 tango departure when all they possessed in FLIP was the Ernam 5 (XXX).  The CP was not experienced enough at this point to be of much help.\r\nThe AC got on the radio with ground/clearance delivery and after multiple radio exchanges sometimes using plain language he was able to \"negotiate\" away the SID which did not exist in DOD flip and get radar vectors for their clearance.\r\nAs stated in the threat with the clearance for the SID they did not possess, when the CP tried to sort out the clearance confusion before engine start, ground /clearance delivery got confused and told them to taxi to runway 28 L when they had been previously told to plan on 10 R.  The FE did not have data for 28 L ready to go.\r\nWhen the different runway from planned situation came up, the FE immediately spoke up and informed the AC that he would have to run data, for 28 L and it would take a little time.\r\nThe AC had to takeover the radios from the inexperienced CP to fix the SID situation (not the CP's fault) so after he had fixed the SID situation the AC also used radio skills to request and receive a clearance for a 10 R taxi and takeoff.\r\nDuring the before engine start checklist, when the FE said ignition, the CP (in the right seat) reached up and put the engine ignition selector switch to start B. (This is procedurally the left seat pilot's duty to do this and respond.)\r\nThe AC (in the left seat), informed the CP that the action and verbal response for the ignition selector switch was supposed to be the left seaters.  The CP acknowledged and stated he agreed and that it was just a mistake.  \r\n\r\nThe air force requires a fire bottle to be in front of the KC10 nose for engine start, even at out stations when ground handlers will not be on headset.  KC10 cockpit crew has very limited visibility of aircraft equipment that is below the aircraft near the nose gear.  At LICZ the fire bottle location was lost track of between pre-flight and marshall out.\r\nThe FE and AC lost track of maintaining a good accounting of what was below the aircraft nose during the preflight, and what was around the aircraft parked next to them. After engine start when the FE challenged with ground equipment, and gear pins,  as part of the before taxi checklist, the AC looked to his left and saw a fire bottle over there, but was not sure if it had just showed up (i.e. ground handlers had just taken it away from under his nose, or if it had already been there and was designated for the aircraft parked to their left.\r\nThe AC admitted he didn't even know if there had been a fire bottle below his nose when he had gotten off the bus and climbed the stairs onto the aircraft.  He solicited the FE for any info he had about the fire bottle situation since the FE had done his 2 walk arounds.  The FE said he couldn't remember.  The AC verbalized his lack of knowing whether the fire bottle he saw to his left had been removed from under his nose by ground handling, or if it had been there before, and whether there currently was a fire bottle under his nose, right in front of his nose gear or not.\r\nHe called the extra boom operator instructor from the back (primary boom was in the cockpit) to the cockpit and asked him to open a door and look under the jet to make sure there was no fire bottle there or anything in the way for that matter. (Outstanding Inquiry)\r\nThe instructor boom opened door 1 L, looked out and reported back to the cockpit that all was clear, and the AC thanked him and responded \"Removed\" in accordance with the before taxi checklist.\r\nDuring taxi out and while holding short of runway 10 R the CP did not brief the abort procedures. 3-3 KC-10 and other sources stipulate that abort procedures should be covered.\r\nThe AC waited until the CP was done his brief and asked, what about abort procedures ?  The CP immediately realized he had forgotten that and gave an excellent abort procedures brief.  This error of forgetting the abort procedures brief happened prior to the threat from the boom operator of not giving an adequate evacuation brief and is not related directly.\r\n\r\nDuring the takeoff brief, while holding short of runway 10R, when prompted by the CP, for an evacuation brief, the boom operator gave a completely inadequate brief.  All he said was \"Um 1 Left.\"\r\nThe AC immediately said they needed a little more than that and prompted the boom operator for more by asking a couple specific questions like \" How many souls on board, do you want o meet 100 feet off the nose ?\" (Outstanding Inquiry)\r\nThe boom operator took the hint and gave a corrected more through evacuation brief.\r\nDuring the takeoff and departure briefing, the CP did not brief the transition altitude for departure.  While not specifically mentioned, guidance in the 3-3, vol 3, and dash one can be interpreted to encompass mentioning the transition altitude when briefing a departure that is not CONUS.\r\nThe FE briefed the transition altitude for the CP when he saw he missed it.

The CP stated, \" Oh yeah\", and rolled out. (Outstanding Monitor/Crosscheck)\r\nOn climb out passing 6000 feet, with a TAT of 14 degrees C the AC said \"We're going in some clouds\" and said to turn on anti-ice.  Engine and wing anti-ice were turned on. The Dash One only requires anti ice on with visible moisture and TAT less than 6 degrees C and states there is an N1 limiter penalty from the thrust computer if anti-ice is used above 8 degrees C.  Although not in the Dash One industry experts also generally agree that anti ice use at high temperatures when not required, can prematurely wear out and or damage acoustic panels of engines.\r\nThe crew seemed happy to have the anti-ice on even though TAT was 14 degrees C and increased when aircraft was accelerated at 10,000 feet due to TAT increase for speed.  It is unclear whether the crew thought the 6 degrees didn't apply if in clouds, it applied to SAT instead of TAT, or if they just had no idea and bought into the cliche that anti ice is free.\r\nThe aircraft was not even in clouds above 15000 feet yet anti-ice was not turned off until 29000 feet.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbWorkloadManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"CruiseNarrative","value":"During cruise at intermediate cruise altitudes topping out at a final of 37000 feet, the accent of the Saudi controllers was very difficult for the crew to communicate with.

The descent profile directed by ATC (TOD directed by ATC) was \"healthy\" but not excessive or a threat.\r\nThe CP mismanaged his power settings, speed profile, flight guidance, and drag configuration throughout the profile in a poor manner.  The autopilot was on for the entire descent profile.\r\nThe AC did an excellent job of being directive with regard to power setting, speed profile, flight guidance, and drag to get the CP (PF) back on a manageable energy profile for descent.  He started making suggestions/inputs to the CP at 29000 feet but had to continue all the way to 5000 feet. (Outstanding Monitor/Crosscheck) This event is captured here as one big error but all the aspects, power setting, drag devices etc all worked together and it could be coded or blamed in multiple ways. It is linked to the error at 3000 feet of leaving the speed brakes out.\r\n10000\r\nAt the end of the descent profile, when passing 4000 feet for 3000 feet, the CP (PF) the CP did not retract the speed brakes.  The aircraft went into ALT CAP and the auto throttles engaged in SPD mode. The auto throttles increased the power setting from idle to a high setting (not over limits) to maintain the 250 knots set in the speed window as the aircraft leveled off. The aircraft was in level flight for over a minute with full speed brakes out, and a high power setting to maintain level flight and set airspeed.\r\nThe AC and FE did not notice, they only noticed when the CP called for slats extend. At this point it got even louder with the high power setting (speed brakes, and slats) in level flight. This cued the AC and he asked if the CP wanted the speed brakes retracted. Granted in this situation the CP had been directed to use speed brakes in the descent which was a good input from the AC but it added to the situation that the CP didn't really know what configuration he was in our wanted (linked to the energy management errors of the CP which was managed very well by the AC).  None of this situation is prohibited or necessarily dangerous, but it is gross poor airmanship and aircraft handling. If they had not caught it when they did, they may have gone to the next configuration which is flaps and that is prohibited by the flight manual with speed brakes.  If the aircraft had not started to get really really loud, the AC may not have ever detected it until the speed brake light would have come on due to flaps. For this reason the aircraft (wind/power/noise) should be credited with an external detection of this error.\r\nDuring VFR weather, on approach at 3000 feet when receiving a final vector to intercept the ILS for 31L, the incorrect TACAN/DME was set. MA was still set and it should have been the DME associated with the ILS frequency to match up with the approach plate DME's.\r\nThe AC knew that something did not add up. He then remembered that although the CP had briefed the correct DME for approach, they had left MA set to help backup what they had programmed in the FMS to navigate to \"point Gulf\".  The AC stated, \"Oh wait a minute, you have the wrong TACAN set right now\", and quickly put the right one in. \r\nOn approach, at 3000 feet, while configuring and going from 250 knots to min maneuver speed, the AC announced that he had \"ALPHA SPD\" on his side in his FMA.  The CPs (PF) FMA was normal (SPD)\r\nThe AC knew exactly what to do, there is no checklist, he let the CP keep the aircraft and directed him to disconnect the auto throttles, then he quickly engaged only ATS 2 and his FMA displayed SPD correctly.\r\nAt 7.6 DME on approach to 31 L , at 2500 feet when the gear was put down at one dot below glide slope, the center gear did not indicate down on the pilot display (red), but did indicate down on FE panel.  \r\nThe crew did not notice, because shortly after asking for the gear the CP (PF) called for flaps 35. They noticed now because the aircraft landing gear warning horn came on in a mode that can not be silenced.  They also would have probably noticed anyway, because the Before Landing Checklist would have directed \"Down 4 green\" from all 3 of them.\r\nThey quickly accessed that they had the good indication on the FE panel.  They were unsure if they had to run a checklist (they do not, the flight manual states that a good indication on either panel means the gear is good).  They went quickly back and forth with what to do, just continue and land with the very annoying landing gear warning horn on, or discontinue the approach and trouble shoot. \r\nThey chose to discontinue the approach and trouble shoot, reference the flight manual.  They did not execute a formal go-around so there were no distinct errors but the CP was not sure what to do with the aircraft.  The AC got a clearance from ATC for a vector and a climb.  The CP was unclear what to do, he  tried to ask for climb N1 and started climbing with vert speed, and the AC realized they were all off any normal profile and suggested they retract the flaps and slats as they speeded up in a climb N1/vert speed combination which was obviously resulting in an airspeed increase in the climb.  There were no specific errors or flight manual violations but it was not an efficient or  well flown jet for a time period.  \r\nThe AC asked the FE to look for any checklist (none apply since they had good indications on the FE panel, not both). With the lack of any other guidance, they decided to recycle the gear which resulted eventually in the same indications up front (bad center gear) and on the FE panel (four green). (Outstanding Contingency Management)\r\nThe AC decided to let the CP fly the approach but had figured out that he was just going to have to land with the warning horn going off. He briefed the crew that they would put the flaps down at 1000 feet AGL to minimize the time spent with the horn blaring.  (Outstanding Plans Stated) \r\nThey landed with no further problems.  In addition, added difficulty was dealt with during all of this because ATC sent them to a holding fix after the initial vector which increased work load for the pilots.  They never actually got to the fix and held because they had sorted through the problem and requested vectors for the approach prior to reaching the fix.\r\nApproach\r\nThe CP flew a very good AP on ILS approach.\r\nLanding   \r\nThe CP made a good landing in the touchdown zone on centerline.\r\nTaxi\r\nDuring taxi in, the TA marshaller gave exact opposite instructions initially. He signalled for a right turn when he meant left.\r\nThe AC did not follow the incorrect instruction, he turned where he knew he should turn (left). After about ten seconds of incorrect marshalling signals the marshaller realized his mistake and switched to the correct signals.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachPlansStated","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachRunwayManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachWorkloadManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCaptainLeadership","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCommunicationEnvironment","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallNarrative","value":"The AC set a relaxed and open communication environment for this mission.\r\nHis leadership was outstanding as exemplified by his supervision of his very inexperienced CP and handling of multiple situations that are not thoroughly or precisely covered in training or directives.

Brand new Co-Pilots are working on masters degrees before even being mission ready.  Additional duties, award packages, EPRs/OPRs, deployments, supervision, PME, AAD's, mandatory fun, all pull attention from the aircrew and make it nearly impossible  to focus on their primary duties.  The AF cares less about being good aviators than making new leaders.  The AF doesn't care if you have a Q3 for advancing in the ranks but if SOS is not complete or a masters degree is not accomplished the member will not be promoted and likely released as an O4 at 16 years of service.  \r\nThis is an institutional problem and has become a fundamental concern for safety.\r\nSuggestion:  Cancel the requirement for AADs, have squadrons re-assess additional duties and if they are not mandatory get rid of them.  Do not make it a requirement to do PME in correspondence  then in residence. Get rid of as many staff jobs as possible  and put the focus back into the cockpit.\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\nCP - Crew fatigue is my #1 concern regarding  flight safety.  Constant scheduling of min ground times and off-circadian rhythm flying is taking a serious toll on a young and relatively inexperienced crew force.  Aircraft utilization and \"efficiency\" cannot be the primary concern when human beings are flying your planes - we must not mirror civilian scheduling models when we are not manned like civilian companies !\r\nDespite the fact that Vol 3 says to allow longer than min ground time, this is rarely done unless some outside factor drives it.  TACC planners seem more focused on pleasing outside organizations - and AMC always yields to others' requirements - than on the care of their own people.\r\nThis isn't FedEx, this is a military organization; we must reduce some of the focus on \"customer service\" and return to a military leadership mindset of taking care of people.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************************\r\nFE - Fatigue from min ground time and constant off-cycle circadian rhythms.

This happened to me and it was indeed used against me.  When I confronted the commander about it I was told \"safety investigations aren't what they used to be\" and received a Q3. I was a safety officer at that time.\r\n*****************************************************************************************\r\nCP - Units must be manned appropriately.  the current KC10 manning model is from the 1980's !  A manning study must be done to determine the appropriate  numbers for squadrons that have seen their manning reduced over a decade of increasing deployments and increasing requirements.  Simply calling this the \"new normal\" or saying \"do more with less\" conveys a tone-deafness on the part of senior leadership that undermines their credibility with the crew force. \r\nReduce the volume of monthly/quarterly /annual awards: These are a tedious time sink !  Stop \"grading\" Wing CCs on timeliness of OPRs/EPRs - we get it, everything's important  but we're busy doing a mission here.  Stop having PRFs for Captains; stop insisting young company grade officers must get masters degrees and PME by correspondence.  It simply can't be done while working a job in the squadron and studying/flying the line.  The only areas to take time from are physical fitness and family life and we're told those are important too.\r\nTACC must schedule with ORM in mind.  Too often  crews are asked to press their own limits in the name of mission accomplishment.  Simply because max duty periods have been established does not mean all cres are capable of executing them.  TACC must ask the tough questions - expecting a crew to speak up is not realistic.  That young AC doesn't know who's on the other end of the phone and is concerned about consequences, real or imagined, for saying \"enough\".  Units are tasked inside of 48 hours all the time without a waiver, SRT's are broken without the crew being looked out for.\r\nAll of the above - poor manning, poor scheduling, administrative pressures, have damaged the most fundamental unit of the Air Force - the squadron.  Air Force Times trumpeted the return of Roll Call as a tool for unit morale and cohesion -  another \"good idea\" to address a problem without addressing the cause.  Crews are tired and poorly managed on the road and at home they don't have adequate time and effort to put toward training.  they don't need more cheer leading, they need relief, less admin, less professional development burdens early, more and better rest while flying the mission.\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\nFE -  Teach

LEMO to LICZ supporting deployment of a six ship of F-22s.  The crew was to pick up the flight from a KC-135 escort, conduct four ARs, and then pass the flight to a KC-10 departing from the same location.  \r\nThe departure location lacked adequate support (trans, base ops, mess hall) for the early morning departure with base operations not opening until 2:45 prior to departure, compressing flight planning time.  The AC did a good job of anticipating the lack of base support and used the hour from alert to crew show to review the IFM paperwork and start flight planning while at the lodging facility. (outstanding contingency management)\r\nAt time of alert, AC was notified that there would be four instead of six fighters due to a fighter MX issue which modified the AR plan with the other tanker. The crew discussed the impact this would have to their fuel load (more fuel on board than required) and how to document it in the paperwork.  The two tanker crews did a good job discussing the changes to the AR and came up with a new plan. (outstanding plans stated)\r\nUpon arrival at the aircraft, the crew found a power cart and O2 cart left by the aircraft.  The AC had requested removal of the equipment 24 hours earlier.  While completing flight panning at base ops, the AC made an additional request to transient alert to have the equipment removed.  The equipment was eventually moved less than one hour prior to scheduled takeoff\r\nDuring the preflight the CFP provided contained a route of flight point that was not part of the filed flight plan.  The copilot subsequently entered the waypoint into the FMS.  During the review of the FMS waypoints, the AC discovered the extraneous point that had been entered in the FMS by the CP.  The AC and CP reviewed the route and deleted the point from the FMS to match the filed flight plan. (outstanding monitor crosscheck)\r\nPrior to engine start, TA was not available when the crew was ready to run checklists.  The crew chiefs went through the avionics bay in the cockpit to perform exterior duties during engine start.  While the crew was running checklists, TA arrived and relieved the crew chiefs.  The crew chiefs came into the cockpit through the avionics bay and interrupted the FE/Pilot TOLD review.  The FE did a good job of pausing where he was and continuing the briefing once the disruption was over.\r\nThe three tanker crews all visually cleared each others' airplanes for any obstacles prior to starting taxi which showed great teamwork.  During taxi out, the crew was given a clearance to taxi on the parallel north of the ramp into an area closed for construction.  The AC had reviewed the notams, discussed the airfield taxi restrictions with airfield management during preflight planning, and briefed the copilot on the taxi plan.  Upon receiving the clearance, the AC queried ATC and received a corrected clearance to taxi south on the parallel and back taxi on the runway.

with a co-located launch and another cell of the same 30 minutes behind.\r\nThe crew found out when they received their EMF that they did not get an ALTRV approved for this Cornet aircraft movement. It did not get approved.\r\nThe AC and the CP discussed the implications of the formation and refueling with the 6 F15s across the ocean and what contingencies they may have to deal with, since they did not have the protection of an ALTRV.  Their excellent discussion included fuel analysis for if they were assigned a much lower block. They determined that although it was flight planned at 240 B 260 without the ALTRV, they could probably do it as low as 17000 feet if required. They realized that they could really only get accurate guesses at fuel burn for themselves and so they passed their concern about fuel without the ALTRV to the DCO to determine his inputs with regard to F15 fuel burn at a lower altitude. (Outstanding Inquiry)\r\nThe DCO said that the fighters could make it at 17000 feet if ATC could only fit them with multiple altitudes lower. He also stated that he had coordinated with ATC and he thought that their would not be any airspace issues, even without the ALTRV.\r\nLater, during the flight, they did in fact get the altitudes they needed, only having to compress the block on one occasion to 2 altitudes instead of 3 with the Japanese sector. Once past that initial sector it was expanded again, and this is probably what would have been the case even if they had an approved ALTRV. In addition, there was a little extra work on radios with ATC at times to confirm that they were not on an ALTRV as even the controllers on the job at the time were not used to a movement of 7 jets without an ALTRV.\r\nThe AC and CP did a great job of anticipating the consequences of this threat during mission planning.\r\nDuring the interior inspection, the CP discovered that his ADI just all of a sudden pitched down to 10 degrees nose low.\r\nThe CP called maintenance up to trouble shoot. The CP informed him what had happened and also said that he had flown this tail number before and seen this happen, and it had been troubleshot by maintenance, went away, and flown with no problems.\r\nMaintenance shut down some systems and pulled and reset some circuit breakers. The CP's ADI appeared to be correct, showing level flight as it should while sitting on the ramp. This process took about 5 minutes and the CP had to suspend his pre-flight activities because the crew chief was shutting things on and off. The CP used the down time to study the paperwork for the mission in the EMF. (Outstanding Workload Management)\r\nDuring the pre-flight activities, the CP had put the IFR clearance on request with ground. Later, he had somehow turned ground control radio off, or the volume down, because they called 4 to 5 times with clearance available, advise ready to copy and he did not respond because he was somehow off that radio.\r\nTheir was no other crew on that radio either at the time.\r\nEventually, later in the process, the CP called again for clearance and ground passed him clearance without any problem.  He had discovered that he was no longer monitoring ground freq, and fixed the problem. I could not tell if he had toggled it off accidently or the volume had gone down.\r\nThe AC discovered during pre-flight that the RGA function of his flight director was not working.\r\nHe informed maintenance. Maintenance trouble shot but was unable to determine the problem and so it was decided by the AC that he would fly without the RGA function and do a gyro takeoff.  The CP's RGA function still worked. The AC checked the MEL to make sure they were in compliance.\r\nThis trouble shooting process by maintenance was distracting to the pilots but they were able to concentrate on their other pre-flight activities with no errors noted.\r\nWhen the AC briefed his takeoff later in the process, he did a good job of discussing the gyro aspect of it because of his in-op RGA.\r\nIn the middle of pre-flight duties, the AMCC called and asked the pilots to relay to the USDA dog guy checking for tree snakes (who was currently at their aircraft outside on the ground), to call command post immediately.\r\nThe CP took the call and then told the crew chief on interphone who was calling flight controls to tell the dog guy. It took a couple interactions with the crew chief and then the CP had to call AMCC  back to tell them they had relayed the message. \r\nThe AC and CP did a good job of remembering where they were in the flight control check with the crew chief and waiting until the distraction of the relay to the USDA guy event was over before they went back to the flight control check.\r\nWhen the CP was loading information into the FSAS during pre-flight to have it process to calculate TOLD, the FSAS basically stopped working. It would not take inputs and wouldn't calculate anything.\r\nThe CP said he had seen this happen before, and he thought he would try something before calling maintenance. He got up and went back to the sideways table, and took out the card for the FSAS, and replaced it with a card from his flight suit pocket. He stated that he remembered that he just happened to have an extra one with him right then.\r\nHe told the AC to try it in about 30 seconds. The AC did and it worked, problem solved.\r\nThe AC, who had spoken to the other KC135 cell 30 minutes behind had been briefed to come up on AR primary 243.5 at engine start time to be able to be on freq. with the co-located fighters. This had been coordinated from the fighters to both sets of tankers and relayed thru the other AC in the other aircraft to this AC.  The AC did not pass that info to the CP.\r\nThe outcome to this error of not passing that piece of info was that the crew was not on the AR primary radio at engine start or taxi out.  While taxiing out the fighter lead called them on ground frequency and asked them to come up 243.5 .  The AC immediately realized his communication error to the CP and his own error of just not making it happen, and stated, \"Oh my bad, we were supposed to come up on that at engine start, he briefed that.\r\nThey came up on that freq. and reported in and there were no further issue","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartPlansStated","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartContingencyManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartWorkloadManagement","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartRunwayManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartInquiry","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbInquiry","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbNarrative","value":"The AC in the left seat was the PF for the takeoff.\r\nOn takeoff rotation the number 2 engine EGT light came on.

This is captured as one threat although it happened 3 times, and it is logged under climb because although it first appeared on takeoff, it happened 2 more times during climb.\r\nThe AC quickly looked at the actual EGT readout and stated, \"EGT number 2, 5 minutes\".  Later when the aircraft power was reduced, the light went out.\r\nDuring the higher altitudes of the climb out, each time the light came on, the AC (PF) assessed it and pulled the throttle back slightly and the light would extinguish after about 3 minutes. (Outstanding Workload Management)\r\nThe AC did a good job of handling this, and in the end it was within limits but needed to be written up in the forms because it was much hotter than the other engines.\r\nThe crew did an excellent job with everything else on the departure and climb out.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbWorkloadManagement","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"CruiseNarrative","value":"TOC to Rendezvous Narrative\r\nWhen the CP checked in with San Francisco, he told them they were a flight of 6.

He could understand Naha very well, but Naha, did not seem to understand him very well.\r\nThe AC gave a hint to the CP at one point to not give Naha options, because it just locked them up, just to state what he wanted and that would be easier for Naha to process.  This helped a little, but the persistence and attention to detail of the CP is what really ending up managing this threat safely to get a good clean breakup of the formation with the F15s.\r\nIt was very good that the CP started coordinating early since it took so long and so many radio calls to get it cleared up.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachInquiry","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachNarrative","value":"TOD / Briefing\r\nPrior to TOD the AC gave an excellent briefing for the ILS runway 23R.\r\nPassing 22000 feet in a pilot discretion descent for 16000 feet ATC gave the CP (PNF) a further descent to 6000 feet and did not issue an altimeter. They also gave a vector with the instructions. The CP was busy finishing up with some items in the CDU, and he read back the heading but not the altitude, and failed to query ATC on a local altimeter as the further clearance to 6000 was below transition.  ATC was a US controller so language was not involved in the issue.\r\nATC did not correct the CP on not reading back the altitude.  The AC who was hand flying, told the CP that they had been given a descent to 6000 and to arm it in the alerter. (Outstanding Monitor/Crosscheck)\r\nThe CP did arm it. The AC told the CP they needed a local altimeter and to ask ATC for it.  When the CP asked ATC for the altimeter, he also confirmed the descent to 6000 feet.  ATC gave him the altimeter, then by his confirmation, implied that maybe the reason ATC had not corrected the CP on not reading back the altitude was because ATC thought the CP was contemplating it. ATC read back \"altimeter XXXX and affirm sir, 6000 feet but you can keep it as a pilot discretion if you like\"\r\nThis would explain why ATC did not correct the CP when he didn't read back the 6000 feet initially, if ATC thought maybe the CP was contemplating if it was PD or not, since he had previously been on a PD to 16000.  That was not the case, the CP purely just failed to read back the altitude clearance, but ATC and the AC did the right thing in assuring the clearance did get passed back and forth correctly.\r\n10000\r\nApproach\r\nThe AC flew a very good descent and approach into runway 23R.\r\nIt is also interesting that this crew called 1000 feet and 500 feet, with a perfect input from the CP at 1000 that the AC was slightly high. In my opinion this crew DID have the stabilized approach criteria and call outs as part of their procedures unlike some of the other KC135 crews.\r\nLanding    \r\nOn landing ground roll still at about 120 kts. on runway 23R the AC and CP saw a pretty big gull bird with probably wingspan of about 4-5 feet, making hoovering circles about 6 feet off the ground right on runway centerline about 500 feet ahead of them.\r\nThey both verbalized it, and the AC (PF) in the right seat did not panic or change anything he did with controlling the aircraft during this critical phase of flight (landing ground roll).  The only bad response in this case would have been to do something rash with the controls in an effort to avoid hitting the bird like swerving with the nose wheel steering, or braking extra hard.. The AC did not do anything stupid like this which was excellent. (Outstanding Contingency Management)\r\nThe both watched as the bird transitioned to left of centerline still in a circling hoovering motion. The AC watched it fly down the left side of his aircraft and it appeared to the AC that it missed them. They had no adverse affects noted on flight controls or engine instruments.  They thought it had missed.\r\nWhen the AC did the walk around post flight he discovered bird debris, blood and feathers in the intake and in the tail cone of the number 1 engine. He informed command post and wing safety via his cell phone, and filled out the bird strike form with maintenance de-brief and the form with wing safety.\r\nThis threat was captured as inconsequential in that it did not link to a cockpit error (the contrary, AC did a good job), although the consequence was a bird strike to the number one engine and all the associated maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxi","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachPlansStated","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachRunwayManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachWorkloadManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCaptainLeadership","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCommunicationEnvironment","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallNarrative","value":"This AC set an open environment for communication.

It helped that they were very experienced with the airspace and environment.\r\nThe hand flying was outstanding.\r\nThe most noteworthy capturing item of data though was that they performed the stabilized approach call outs perfectly in contrast to some other 135 crew sampled. (the lesson here is that the stabilized approach criteria is completely unstandardized through the 135 community. It is standard now in the KC10 because it is in the vol 3, but in the 135 the data is in some wing's FCBs, some not so much, some 135 wings think it is gone)\r\nThis is the fault of AMC 135 stan eval  and training, re-issue the FCIF to the 135 community, put it in the vol 3 as an interim safety supp, or contact all wings and assure they retained it to the FCB. If it does exist in some AMC FCB it is failing as a communication medium and seems to not be reaching guard or reserve.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallDebriefType","value":"Not Sure","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallMAFDebriefingGuide","value":"DK","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallTEMPerformance","value":"DK","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"InterviewQuestion1","value":"AC - There seems to be a mind set of needing to cover your self if you make a mistake rather than being up front with it to aid as a learning tool for others.\r\nCP - Lack of focus on pilot general knowledge and expertise due to USAF career emphasis proving to be more important (PME, graduate degree, non-flying extra-curricular activities)","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"InterviewQuestion2","value":"AC - Flight Ops: we need young pilots to be experts in the aircraft before they man the desk.

offload/onload and refueling at OKBK.  The crew was just observed on the previous flight and consisted of an instructor pilot AC, new CP (FPQ), a instructor BO and a basic FE.\r\nWhile updating the weather at the Air Terminal Operations Center, the AC noticed the planned alternate of EDDS had a temporary ceiling of 400 feet in light freezing drizzle.  This weather is less than required for a legal alternate.  The AC checked the regulations to confirm the alternate minimums.  The AC then contacted the Flight Manager and they decided EGUN would be the new alternate.  The Flight Manager told the AC he would run a new fuel plan.  While that was being accomplished, the AC calculated they would need another 15000 pounds of fuel.  The AC told the refuelers to fill the aircraft to 160000 pounds of fuel; 15000 pounds more than the original flight plan fuel load.  The Flight Manager eventually arrived at the same fuel load number.  (OUTSTANDING EVALUATION OF PLANS)\r\nWhile the AC was speaking with the Flight Manager, the other pilots checked the filed route against the charts and reviewed the NOTAMS.  The pilots then proceeded to the aircraft. \r\nThe CP entered the route of flight in the FMS and an additional pilot checked the FE calculated TOLD.  The CP and AC did confirm the FMS route of flight together.\r\nPrior to engine start, the CP contacted Ground Control for clearance.  The aircraft was cleared as filed and was directed to climb to FL220.  Ground control directed the aircraft to contact Tower for push back and start up clearance.\r\nThe aircraft was parked nose to tail with a C-5 on a small tight ramp with multiple instructions.  The aircraft did not have enough room to make a 180 degree turn out of parking.  The ground crew informed the AC he would be pushed back out of his spot onto an active taxiway.\r\nWhile waiting for the push back crew to connect the tug, the CP (PF) started to conduct his departure briefing.  The CP (PF) was interrupted by the Ground Crew about halfway through the briefing informing the AC they were ready for push back.  The AC directed the CP to call for push back clearance from Tower.  (MAGINAL SOP BRIEFING)\r\nWhen the CP called Tower for push back clearance, the Tower cleared the aircraft to start engines.  The crew misinterpreted this clearance to mean they were cleared to push back and commenced the push back without explicit ATC approval.  The AC directed the FE to run the push back checklist and the Ground crew to begin the push back.  During push back, Command Post called to inform the aircraft they were supposed to start engines PRIOR to push back and then call for push back clearance.  The AC elected to start engines 1 and 3 during push back.  (MARGINAL INQUIRY)\r\nAfter accomplishing the Push Back checklist but prior to push, the AC queried the FE if the brake anti-skid should be selected off.  The FE told the AC that turning off the anti-skid was an old procedure and no longer required.  The FE turned off the anti-skid anyway even though it was not directed by the checklist.  The crew pushed back with the anti-skid off and the FE turned it back on prior to taxi.  (MARGINAL INQUIRY)\r\nAfter informing the crew they needed to start engines prior to push back, Command Post interrupted the engine start to ask the crew to call Tower and have Tower contact Command Post since they were unable to contact Tower on the land line.  The CP called Tower and relayed the message.  A few minutes later Tower interrupted the crew running checklists to ask for the phone number to call.  The crew called Command Post got the number and relayed it to Tower.\r\nAfter completing the push back onto the active parallel taxiway, the crew had to wait for the crew chief to board the aircraft through the front nose gear since he had the steering bypass pin.  Tower called the aircraft because there was another aircraft attempting to taxi on the taxiway.  The CP told ATC they were ready to taxi when they were called since the crew chief was just entering the cockpit through the nose gear hatch.\r\nThe crew started the number 2 engine while they were waiting for the crew chief to board the aircraft.\r\nWhile taxing on the parallel taxiway to hold short of Runway 33R, the CP (PF) continued his takeoff briefing that was interrupted by the push back crew.  The CP (PF) failed to brief the evacuation plan.  The BO noticed the omission and queried the CP (PF) about the evacuation plan.  The CP (PF) then had the BO brief the evacuation.

The BO did the same thing again when the aircraft was climbing through 8000 feet.  Though initially distracted, the pilots turned back to the front of the cockpit and their instruments and clearing duty.\r\nClimbing through 4000 feet the CP (PF) engaged the autopilot and ATC cleared the aircraft direct BOSAD.  Passing through 10000 feet the CP (PF) accelerated to 330 knots for the climb.  At FL180, ATC issued a further climb to FL280.\r\nClimbing through FL250, ATC cleared the aircraft direct to a fix but the crew could not understand the point due to the controller accent.  The AC (PNF) queried the controller several times and eventually through phonetic spelling the crew was able to determine the clearance.\r\nThe AC (PNF) failed to make the 1000 foot call climbing through FL270 for FL280.

The crew obtained the ATIS while level at FL220.  This temperature would require a temperature correction to the ILS decision height (DH).  The AC (PF) briefed the weather during his approach briefing.  The AC (PF) failed to brief a low temperature correction to the ILS Runway 26 decision height (DH).\r\nThe AC (PF) conducted the brief 30 minutes prior to landing at FL220.  The ATIS was reporting a temperature of minus 2 degrees celsius.  The AC (PF) failed to brief the temperature corrected DH for the ILS to Runway 26 and just briefed the DH from the approach chart which both pilots set with their altimeter bugs.  After the brief was completed, the FE queried the pilots if they needed to calculate a temperature corrected DH.  The pilots admitted they forgot to accomplish this procedure.  The AC (PF) gave the FE the Flight Information Handbook to calculate the temperature corrected DH.  The FE directed the pilots to add 20 feet to the DH which both pilots set with their altimeter bugs.  (OUTSTANDING INQUIRY)\r\nThe aircraft entered icing conditions passing FL170 for FL160.  The TAT was -3, the SAT was -24 and visible moisture was present.  The FE turned on the engine and wing anti-ice.  The anti-ice remained on through descent, touchdown and taxi in.  \r\nAt FL160, ATC cleared the aircraft direct point FRANK, the IAF for the ILS Runway 26.  ATC issued further descents to FL120 then FL60.  The AC (PF) started to slow to 250 knots descending through FL114 and was at 250 knots by FL100.\r\n10000\r\nDescending through FL090, ATC cleared the aircraft for a further descent to 3600 feet, issued a vector to final and cleared the crew for the ILS to Runway 26.\r\nApproach\r\nThe crew did not accomplish the Approach check until 7000 feet after being cleared for the ILS to Runway 26.  According to the KC-10 flight manual, this check is normally accomplished after passing 14000 feet especially Step 5 which states \"ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING STEPS PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE APPROACH:  5. CDUs/EHSI/Radio Aids . . . . . \"SET\" (P ,CP ,FE).\"  The Approach check was completed by 6000 feet after intercepting the localizer.\r\nApproach control told the aircraft to contact Tower at 12 miles when the aircraft was at 3600 feet.  When the CP (PNF) contacted Tower, Tower informed the crew that a C-17 that just landed reported a ceiling at 250 feet.  The CP (PNF) acknowledged the PIREP.\r\nThe crew completed the Before Landing check at 3000 feet.  The aircraft was stabilized by 2000 feet and stabilized approach criteria were maintained from 2000 feet through touchdown.\r\nThe CP (PNF) failed to make the 1000 and 500 foot stabilized approach callouts.  The AC (PF) landed the aircraft from a stabilized approach.\r\nAt 300 feet AGL on the ILS Runway 26 approach, Command Post called to find out if the aircraft had any seat kits on the airplane.  This occurred just as the aircraft was breaking out of the weather at minimums.  The BO answered Command Post that they did not have any seat kits on board.\r\nAs the aircraft cleared the weather at 200 feet on the ILS Runway 26, the pilots noticed there was unreported snow accumulation on the runway and the full width of the runway was not plowed.

The AC felt C2 takes a reactive versus proactive approach to flight operations.  When conditions change that can affect an aircraft landing at its destination, C2 does not inform the crew.  One example would be the weather going below minimums.  Another example was a NOTAM change while the AC was enroute to McGuire AFB requiring Operations Group Commander approval to land because of a forecast snowstorm.  Though the AC had called McGuire Command Post twice while enroute to McGuire to update them on the mission landing information, the new NOTAM requirement was never passed to the crew.  It was not until the crew was on final shooting an approach to minimums just prior to the BASH window closing the field that they were denied landing clearance and told to contact McGuire Command Post.  While the crew was trying to understand why they needed Operations Group approval to land, they were getting low on fuel.  Finally, with 2000 pound of fuel above alternate bingo, the AC told Command Post they would be diverting and the plane would not be back until after a crew rest period unless they were granted landing approval.  Command Post granted landing approval and the aircraft landed out of another approach to minimums (with an accompanying BASH waiver).","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"InterviewQuestion2","value":"The crew felt AMC needs to do a better job consolidating the flying regulations.  The pilots pointed out all of the required flight information is scattered among multiple sources and is difficult to locate.  For example, the weather requirement for the destination and alternate are divided among AFI 11-202 and the KC-10 Volume 3.  Additionally, North Atlantic Track information is divided among the KC-10 Volume 3, AP, AFI 11-217 and the MNPS document.  The CP who is an airline pilot noted that Jeppesen provides airlines with 10-7 pages that describe procedures that apply to that field and are different than normal.  He pointed out a military pilot has to go to the Enroute Supplement, the Giant Report, AP, etc. to get the same information consolidated in a few pages at his airline.

The AC (PNF) verified what the CP put into the FMS, but allowed him to continue loading the approach while flying the aircraft. \r\n\r\n10000\r\nWith the exception of the final approach portion, all other crosscheck items would have been outstanding. The crew did an excellent job verifying altitudes and points entered into the flight plan. \r\n\r\nApproach\r\nWhile on the approach, the AC (PNF) failed to make the stabilized approach callouts (Both 1000 and 500). Due to the lack of verbalized callouts, the CP (PF) seemed unaware that he was not in a stabilized approach. His speed was increasing and his descent rate also increasing. At 1000 feet he was 13 knots fast and 700 fpm descent rate. At 500 feet he was still 10-13 knots fast and his VVI increased to 1000 fpm. \r\nAfter hand flying a fast, high descent rate approach, the crew received an ILS glide slope warning (Audible: \"GLIDE SLOPE\"). The AC quickly silenced this by pressing the Glide Slope Inhibit switch. The crew did not discuss or realize why this caution was sounding. At one point, 200 feet AGL, the PAPI indicated 4 RED lights. Against command guidance, the crew continued the approach. \r\nAfter the crew failed to execute a missed approach at 500, when they were outside of stabilized parameters, and after they silenced the GS inhibit, it was clear they were intentionally disregarding guidance and landing from an unstable approach. The CP even mentioned later in the bus that it was not the best of approaches. \r\nLanding    \r\nAlthough the entire approach was flown low and fast, the pilot made adjustments and forced the airplane to touchdown 2000 feet down the runway. His touchdown speed was still fast, about 5-10 knots above normal touchdown speed. However, the landing flare was fine and transfer of aircraft control was well coordinated. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaxi\r\nWhile taxiing the aircraft into the parking area, the CP realized that one of the maintenance vehicles was not behind the line and he directed the AC to stop. The AC stopped the aircraft and waited for about 2 minutes before the vehicle operator moved out of the way. \r\n\r\nAfter the flight, the crew failed to annotate the 781 with 2 required write-ups: the failure of the main pressurization and the failure of the ground power unit to provide aircraft power.

The active duty crew chose to have the FP sit in the left seat and the MP sit in the right seat. For the sake of the threat/error descriptions, I left them based on seat. So the FP who was sitting in the left seat is referred to as the \"AC\" in all the descriptors. The MP who was the aircraft commander is referred to in all the descriptions as the CP because he was in the right seat. The takeoff was performed by the FP in the left seat and the landing by the MP in the right seat. No interview was accomplished due to previous LOSA observation. They provided their responses on their positioning leg into the deployed location. They stated they did not have any further inputs. \r\nThis was a very interesting crew dynamic because the aircraft commander was a senior officer who had flown other aircraft, however had very little time in the MWS. The FP had more hours and sat in the left seat for the flight. The crew worked well together. There was no real clear leader of the crew, but this was helped through excellent communication. The senior officer clearly had the ability to make sound decisions, but always included the FP who possessed superior technical knowledge with respect to the airplane. (Outstanding Communication Environment)\r\nThe noteworthy point on this flight was the approach. The approach was ugly. The crew should have executed a go-around on two separate occasions. The four red and high descent rate almost made this OBSERVER shout out. They continued to a safe final landing, but it was not pretty at all. \r\nThe other item worth mentioning is that both crews I flew with on OTBH round robins overlooked multiple maintenance issues. The modus operandi appears to be that everyone is just used to stuff not working there and they don't write it up because they know it won't get fixed. I learned through conversations with other crew that there seems to be a large lacking of maintenance writeups and maintenance fixes because of this. Probably not a good situation.

This allowed the crew to determine that they were approximately 20 nautical miles behind the receivers and could push up the cruise speed to catch the receivers. The crew later discovered this was not an aircraft malfunction, but was actually linked to a missed checklist item where the PNF failed to configure the Tacan correctly.  The crew discovered the problem after they were unable to get DME from the receivers.  The CP double checked the settings and switch positions and realized it was set improperly, corrected the settings and continued with a functioning Air-to-Air Tacan.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nAR Narrative\r\nThe receivers were two USN F-18 Hornets refueling via Drogue.   \r\nAR #1-10 all completed smoothly without notable errors.\r\nAt FL250 after the first AR, the AC attempted to accelerate to 330 KIAS without confirming the drogue properly stowed.

He failed to give me a solid time to process the 18 passengers and crew.  It ultimately took 30 minutes.  \r\nCP - Most pilots don't trust military weather shops.  Pilots would rather get their weather information from ADDS weather.  I've personally seen weather reports from the military that have clear skies between Okinawa and Guam yet when I've checked ADDS weather there was a no kidding Typhoon between the two.  I could give hundreds of examples of people doing the minimum. Another example of poor service is the U-drive system.  If we are lucky enough to get a car we are expected to return the car with a full tank and at some bases wash the car before we leave. If they want me to do their job for them can I ask them to do my walk-a-round inspection for me when I'm forced to carry them on my jet?  How about asking them to clear the clogged toilet bowl or clean up vomit from a sick passenger?  I don't ask them to do these things when they use our jet why do they ask me to wash their car when I use their car?

\r\n#1\r\nThe crew transportation that showed up at the hotel was not big enough for the entire crew.  The bus driver had to go back to the airport to get a bigger vehicle.  The bus was scheduled to arrive at 0615.  The bus arrived 20 minutes late, which contributed to a late takeoff. \r\n#2\r\nUpon landing after the previous sortie, TACC recommended a 55K fuel load.  The crew requested the aircraft be fueled to 60K.  The day of the flight, TACC calculated a 72K fuel load.  The crew had to add 12K prior to takeoff.  Fueling took an hour and 20 minutes, as the airport services were just beginning to operate.  This contributed to the crew's late takeoff. \r\n#3\r\nThe airport that the crew was to operate out of (YPDN) has limited services.  Employees of the airport told the crew that customs, immigrations, and maintenance would not be able to support an early morning takeoff.  They requested that the crew slip there takeoff to 0830 local time at the earliest.  Even though the crew relayed this information to the flight planner, the takeoff time on the provided 1801 (flight plan) was still incorrect.  The crew was forced to call TACC prior to flight to re-coordinate their flight times and Diplomatic clearances.  This is one of the factors that caused a late takeoff. \r\n#4\r\nCrew members are forced to use personal email accounts to download IFM papers at the Darwin Airport (Australia).  TACC policy does not allow the last three pages of the IFM package to be emailed over unsecure means.   The crew was unable to confirm their diplomatic clearances and other pertinent information within the IFM package.  They confirmed that information over an Australian cell phone, which was probably less secure than a military member's personal email account.

(HHD) mission, this crew was not alerted by the command post. This is normal practice for home station missions that are HHQ even if they are local missions with local crews. The command post did not alert the crew at any point and so this was a threat to the crew as it was a C2 personnel error.\r\nThe AC called the command post when he was not alerted at the appointed time and figured out that they had dropped the ball. He called his crew and they showed up on time so as not to jeopardize the mission.  As the AC knew that the command post regularly messes this up, he took the initiative to take matters into his own hands and so this is captured as an anticipated threat.\r\nDuring the pre-flight mission study the CP realized that the fuel load would be very high up at 165 K which put the aircraft at high gross weight for operations out of RODN.  Current KC135 departure planning has been through a lot of changes recently and this high gross weight would require extra scrutiny by the pilot team to make sure they were operating procedurally correct.\r\nThe CP recognized the threat of the high gross weight with the recently changed and intensified departure planning procedures and brought it up to the AC during mission planning.  He asked that both of them look at the numbers in the squadron as well as when they were out at the aircraft loading the box.\r\nDuring the intel brief for this HHQ mission the intel briefer had given the crew the incorrect ATO data in their TAC binder.\r\nThe CP caught it immediately when the briefer stated information that was completely different than the information he was crosschecking it against in the TAC binder. He saw that the slide the briefer was briefing from was a different ATO day then the info in the binder. He stated so to the briefer, the briefer immediately acknowledged their error and stated they would reconcile and make whole the binder before the crew departed the vault, which they did thanks to the CP's crosschecking and speaking up.\r\nAlso prior to leaving the vault the pilots conducted an outstanding buddy departure formation brief with the E8 JSTARS via telephone.  They did a very professional job of covering everything. (Outstanding SOP Briefing)\r\nThe CP realized also during pre-flight mission planning that one of the points on route of flight had conflicting information about it.  The point had actually been moved from what was in the DAFIF data base and what was printed on FLIP enroute charts.  There was conflicting information out there between FLIP, an updated FLIP enroute chart, the DAFIF database for the FMS, what showed up on the CFP and an email from the ops officer.  Depending on what you referred to you could get different answers as to the lat long of the way point.\r\nThe CP was right on top of this. He mentioned it a couple times to the AC during mission planning, that they would have to make sure they had the most correct lat long typed into the FMS. As the CP sorted it all out, the ops officer seemed to have the accurate info in his email which is not what made it onto the CFP.\r\nIn the end, the CP's efforts were great but when they picked up their IFR clearance from clearance delivery later, the point had been deleted from their cleared route of flight so it did not matter.  This whole matter, though consumed significant discussion and effort during pre-flight ops.\r\n\r\nJust before engine start when the AC was trying to get the clearance from clearance delivery he was getting very tripped up by ATC telling him that they were clearing them to a clearance limit after the VFR/tactical pop up point.  The AC was insisting that they were only cleared to the point they were going tactical.\r\nThis is an error on the AC's part in understanding clearances because by issuing the clearance all the way through the initial IFR portion, and then the tactical/VFR portion, they were clearing them to fly the VFR portion also, which of course in this case was just to set things up timing wise so that when the crew popped up to receive the second (post tactical) portion of the clearance, ATC would know where they were.  The AC spent an inordinate amount of time on this issue when a little general knowledge of the situation or just acceptance of ATC's way of clearing them would have allowed them to move on without a hitch.\r\nThe AC and the CP seemed to not detect their error, but ATC explained it to them, that they cleared them through the VFR portion in order to set up the IFR pickup on the other end of the tactical/VFR portion.  The CP and AC hesitatingly accepted the explanation of clearance delivery but this was only after the already referred to extensive back and forth over the issue.\r\nThe CP (AC qualified) did the walk around as part of pre-flight ops and discovered that a pin for the door in the single point re-fueling access door was missing.  He brought this up to the crew chief who informed him that it was in the aircraft forms.  Then the CP stated that he didn't remember seeing it in there but would check when he went back up to the cockpit.\r\nWhen he re-checked the aircraft forms, post walk-around, he could not find any write up about the pin for the door in there.\r\nThe CP did an excellent job of standing his ground on this issue and following through. He stated to the crew chief on interphone that he was concerned that if the missing pin was not documented in the forms he was not assured that maintenance was certain there were no adverse in flight affects. He told the crew chief that he wanted to see the pro-super to see if he just wasn't seeing it in the forms or to put it in the forms, either way.\r\nThis one played out very strangely from here.  While the pro-super was up in the cockpit inspecting the forms, the crew chief came on interphone and stated that he had found the pin lying on the ground under the fuselage (randomly). Now the CP and AC definitely said something didn't smell right. The pro-super, finally admitted that it was not in the forms.  He stated that it previously had been in there, and that is what the crew chief was remembering, but had then been fixed, and so purged from the forms. The CP quickly got past the obvious bad data he had been given by the crew chief, and went to the current heart of the matter, that it wasn't fixed, had been laying on the ramp, and wasn't in the forms.\r\nThe pro-super agreed, and in this observer's opinion, was so grateful that the CP and AC were not making a big deal about the poor maintenance performance that he quickly stated that he could wire the door shut for flight, put it in the forms, get them on their way and fix it when the plane landed. The AC and CP were happy with that because now maintenance was signing off with a flyable discrepancy and it was all documented.\r\nIn the middle of the threat about maintenance documenting in the aircraft forms about the missing pin for the single point re-fueling access door the maintainer on headset asked the CP in the left seat if he could depressurize so that the pro-super could look inside the wheel well doors. The crew was in the middle of the flight control check which requires pressurized hydraulics so this was an interruption to the crews pre-flight duties during the critical check of the flight controls.\r\nThe CP wisely told the crew chief to standby until they were finished the flight controls/interior inspection checklist, thus avoiding a possible error in the completion of the checklist and the critical flight control check. (Outstanding Workload Management)\r\nAfter engine start the AC in the right seat attempted to turn on each anti-ice IAW the checklist.  The # 4 engine anti-ice did not come on.  \r\nThe AC informed the CP that he was not getting the switch to come on. The CP added that he had flown this tail before and had encountered the same problem.  He told the AC to keep trying. After about 8 tries the AC got the # 4 anti-ice to come on. Problem solved.  The crew tried to anticipate their actions if they could not resolve the issue while they simultaneously tried to resolve the issue by re-attempting to bring on the # 4 anti-ice.\r\nFor this night sortie, the CP in the left seat noticed that the marshaller only had one wand that was lighted (he had 2 but only one lighted).  This is technically against AF regs for the marshaller to only have one wand.\r\nThe CP was very uncomfortable about taxiing in knowing violation of this rule, quite frankly especially with a LOSA observer in his jump seat. He had to balance all this with the fact that this was a higher headquarters, formation buddy launch with a E8 JSTARS and delaying for this reason may affect a real world  mission.\r\nThe CP did an outstanding job of verbalizing this honestly to the AC, and all the associated issues. Added to this, he told the AC he thought there was sufficient ambient lighting on the part of the ramp they were in for one lighted wand, they were familiar as it was their home field , that there were no obstacles, and the taxi lines would keep them clear through the marshallers designated responsible area.\r\nIn this observer's opinion the crew made an informed, risk calculated and managed, decision to proceed.

The AC turned on anti-ice.\r\nPassing 10000 feet for higher the AC in the right seat turned on the autopilot and engaged the NAV/LOC mode. The aircraft did not turn as the AC wished, so he disengaged the autopilot. The AC in the right seat was trying to proceed direct to the ATC cleared way point and had it set up on the right side primary nav source, but the CP in the left seat had been busy loading some other items in the center box and did not have FMS selected as the primary NAV source.\r\nThe AC could have easily just used the roll mode of the autopilot to steer the aircraft in alignment with the right side FMS (primary NAV source FMS) which was giving guidance to the ATC cleared way point. This is a simple automation error by the AC selecting the NAV LOC roll mode of the autopilot without checking to confirm that the left seat primary NAV source was as desired.\r\nThe AC managed his error well initially by disengaging the autopilot when it didn't turn and hand flying the aircraft to the desired heading. As he rolled out on the correct heading and re-engaged roll and pitch modes of the autopilot he saw that the left seat NAV source was not FMS, verbalized it to the CP and once it was correct re-coupled to NAV LOC without further incident.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbWorkloadManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"CruiseNarrative","value":"TOC to Rendezvous Narrative\r\nWhile level at 32000 feet the receiver aircraft asked the crew if they could start air refueling before the tactical point. The request was because the receiver was running late for their on station time and wanted to try and air refuel early, so they could get on station earlier.  The difficulty of it was that air refueling would obviously require block altitudes which are difficult to get in Asian airspace when not tactical.  The receiver was not familiar with the Asian theater and solicited the request from the 135 crew since they were very familiar with the airspace.\r\nThe CP's suggestion was to get both aircraft to the actual altitudes for refueling well prior to the tactical point and also join laterally (but separated by 1000 feet), putting the receiver 1 mile in trail.  This was very possible the CP thought from his experience with local ATC since it would not involve block altitudes or an air refueling that had not been filed for.  He thought the receiver would go for it, since it would mean air-refueling immediately at the go tactical point instead of waiting until the track CP.\r\nThis was outstanding S/A and threat management by the CP.  When it was explained to the receiver he was pleased with the option for his timing as it would get him post AR sooner. It all worked out as the CP predicted, including the cooperation with ATC and the customer satisfaction of the receiver.\r\nDuring the tactical portion of this mission the crew had to deal with GCI (Cobra control) as well as Incheon civil ATC.  It makes it difficult to conduct air refueling, comply with the busy GCI instructions as well as monitor ATC and take their traffic calls.  This threat is captured in the TOC to Rendezvous because that is where it started but it continued through the air refueling phase of flight as well.\r\nThe AC and CP did a great job of teamwork in distinctly assigning radios to each of the them. The PF (CP) was assigned to the primary AR frequency and the PNF (AC) was assigned to monitor GCI C2 and respond to the many calls from them, as well as monitor the Incheon frequency (ATC) with not as many calls.\r\nAR Narrative\r\nAR #1 Boom / E8 JSTARS\r\nDuring air refueling with the E8 at 25000 feet, the CP and AC determined that they would intentionally not put the TCAS in TA in accordance with the prep for air refueling squadron due to their concerns about the crowded tactical airspace they were operating in.  They left in TA/RA for the entire AR on purpose.\r\nThis was in intentional deviation from the checklist due to the crew's perception of the crowded airspace they were in. This perception was from previous experience in this airspace.\r\nCruise - TOD Narrative\r\nThe crew did an outstanding job of flying back from the air refueling.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachInquiry","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachNarrative","value":"TOD / Briefing\r\nThe CP gave an excellent briefing on the ILS to 5L.\r\nDuring the descent for approach and landing when still level at 16000 feet and given a clearance for 6000 feet the AC (PNF) in the right seat incorrectly set the altitude alerter at 5900 feet instead of 6000 feet.

The AC (PNF) in the right seat did not hear the command because he did not move the flaps.  Because this command was not acted on immediately the CP is also credited with the error because he did not ensure that his communication was received.\r\nThe CP in the left seat initially did not catch that the AC did not hear him command 40 flaps and started to slow the aircraft to the next target speed, but quickly realized that the flaps were not set to 40 as he had commanded.  He called for them again and made sure the AC heard him this time.

I would attribute the AC's overall strength of confidence to the excellent job he did of not showing any signs of being threatened by the CP's experience and aggressiveness ( good aggressiveness !).

instructor AC, a new CP (FPQ) and an FE.  This mission started at an enroute stop after a previous night layover.\r\nWhen the crew dropped the bags off at the aircraft prior to proceeding to Base Operations, they noted a pile of snow in front of the number 1 engine intake.  The AC and FE were concerned this snow would be ingested in the engine during start.  The AC asked the crew chiefs to coordinate having the snow removed while the FE and pilots went to Base Operations.  By the time the crew came out several hours later, the snow had been removed.  (OUTSTANDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT)\r\nWhen the AC checked in with Command Post, there was no IFM paperwork for the mission available for the scheduled leg from ETAR to KWRI.  After about 20 minutes, Command Post told the AC it appeared the mission had been rescheduled to proceed to ETAD and then to KWRI.\r\nCommand Post informed the AC when they arrived at the window that they had been rescheduled to go to ETAD then KWRI instead of straight to KWRI but they did not know why the mission was rescheduled.  The AC called TACC and after about 20 minutes was told the mission had been rescheduled through ETAD in order to deliver a part for a broken C-5.  The AC asked why they would reschedule a KC-10 at $20000 an hour to fly a part to a destination that was only 90 minutes away by ground transportation.  After another 20 minute delay, TACC said this part could not be delivered by ground because it had hazardous material inside it.  (OUTSTANDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT)\r\nThe KC-10 had already been refueled to 175000 pounds of fuel in anticipation of flying to its original destination of KWRI.  Since TACC had rescheduled the mission to ETAD which is only about a 20 minute flight, the aircraft would be overweight for landing at its destination when taking the cargo load into account.  The AC informed TACC of this issue and TACC directed the AC to defuel the aircraft as necessary to arrive at ETAD at an allowable landing weight.  (OUTSTANDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT)\r\nDue to mission being rescheduled from KWRI to ETAD and the short flight time involved from ETAR to ETAD, there was no IFM package available for the mission.  TACC told the AC the crew would need to do the mission planning and file the flight plan.  The pilots started planning the mission.\r\nWhen pilots reviewed Global Decision Support System remarks during mission planning, they noticed a remark directing an engine running offload (ERO) of the part at ETAD and then to proceed to KWRI.  The AC informed TACC that a KC-10 could not accomplish an ERO.  Additionally, since the aircraft had to defuel to land at ETAD below maximum landing weight, the aircraft would have to receive fuel at ETAD to make the trip to KWRI.  (OUTSTANDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT)\r\nWhile planning for the rescheduled leg from ETAR to ETAD, the pilots found the weather was below ceiling minimums and was forecast to remain below minimums for 5 more hours.  The crew had already been at Command Post for 2 hours at this point.  The AC called TACC to tell them about the forecast weather.  TACC directed the AC to wait on the weather to improve so they could fly the leg to ETAD.  The AC informed TACC that taking into account defueling the aircraft, the cost of flying a KC-10 and the poor weather that this additional leg was a bad idea.  The AC suggested TACC reexamine ground delivery of the part or a later scheduled aircraft that was in a better weather window accomplish the mission.  (OUTSTANDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT)\r\nAfter another 20 minute delay, TACC agreed with the AC that defueling the aircraft and waiting 5 hours for the weather to improve was a bad plan.  TACC rescheduled the mission back to KWRI with no ETAD stop.  The AC asked TACC for an IFM package back to KWRI since one was never accomplished.\r\nTACC took over 30 minutes to produce an IFM package for ETAR to KWRI while the crew waited at Base Operations.  The AC sent the extra crewmembers to the aircraft while he waited on the IFM paperwork.  After receiving the paperwork, the AC and CP checked the route against the charts, checked the NOTAMS, confirmed the fuel load and proceeded to the aircraft.  (OUTSTANDING WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT)\r\nDuring preflight, ATIS was reporting calm winds, 2400 meters on the visibility, 500 foot ceiling, a wet runway, temperature 3 degrees celsius, using Runway 26 for departure.  These conditions were conducive to icing.  The FE planned the TOLD using engine and wing anti-ice and the additional pilot checked the TOLD.\r\nThe CP loaded the FMS and both pilots checked the route of flight together.\r\nThe CP called Ground Control for clearance prior to engine start.  Ground Control informed the CP clearance would be issued upon taxi.  The CP commented to the AC that it would be better if clearance were received prior to taxi so the crew could focus clearing during taxi instead of writing down a clearance.  The crew did copy clearance during taxi from Ground Control.  (OUTSTANDING TAXIWAY/RUNWAY MANAGEMENT)\r\nIcing conditions were present during start with a temperature of 3 degrees celsius and visible moisture present.  The FE turned the engine and wing anti-ice on after engine start.\r\nAfter the FE turned the engine and wing anti-ice on after engine start for the icing conditions, the #1 engine anti-ice disagreement light illuminated on the overhead panel.  The AC said not to worry about it now and directed the CP to call for taxi.  No procedure or checklist was accomplished.  The crew taxied without running any procedure or checklist.  The light extinguished after about 1 minute of taxi with the throttle at a higher power setting.\r\nTaxi\r\nThe CP called Ground Control for taxi and the aircraft was cleared to taxi to Runway 26.  As earlier anticipated, as soon as the crew started taxing on the congested ramp Ground Control asked if the crew was ready to copy clearance.  The CP told Ground Control to standby and they would copy clearance when clear of the crowded ramp area.  After clearing the ramp, Ground Control cleared the  aircraft via the TOLEY2N up to FL70.  (OUTSTANDING TAXIWAY/RUNWAY MANAGEMENT)\r\nWhile taxing on the crowded ramp to the runway, the FE was heads down loading the computer flight plan in the laptop computer and not helping the crew clear for obstacles.  The FE continued loading the laptop throughout taxi except when running a checklist.\r\nETAR requires a German noise abatement climb to 3000 at V2+10.  The CP failed to brief or follow the German noise abatement procedures.\r\nDuring taxi out, the CP (PF) conducted the departure briefing.  The CP (PF) failed to brief the German noise abatement procedures which require a climb at V2+10 until 3000 feet AGL then aircraft clean up with a thrust reduction at 1500 feet AGL.  No one caught the missed briefing item.

The CP (PNF) acknowledged ATC and the AC (PF) met the ATC restriction.\r\nThe crew failed to complete the Descent check prior to departing FL360.  The AC (PF) called for the Descent check descending through FL260 and the check was completed by FL225.\r\nDescending through FL220 for 16000 feet, the aircraft entered icing conditions.  The TAT was -12, SAT was -34 and there was visible moisture present.  The FE turned on the engine and wing anti-ice.\r\nThe Tower was reporting a wet runway when the CP (PNF) contacted Tower descending through FL180 for 160000 feet.  The FE calculated TOLD taking a wet runway into account.\r\nATC issued a further descent to 7000 feet.  Descending through 13500 feet, the aircraft was cleared direct CYN.  After CYN, ATC cleared the aircraft direct the IAF for the RNAV/GPS Runway 6 and issued a further descent to 3000 feet.\r\n10000\r\nDescending through 8000 feet for 3000 feet, the crew broke sterile with extraneous conversation that continued throughout the approach.  The crew safely flew the approach.\r\nWhile level at 3000 feet proceeding to the IAF, ATC issued a traffic advisory three times for traffic at 1 o'clock, 1000 feet below the aircraft.  The CP (PNF) acknowledged ATC and eventually the pilots reported the traffic in sight to ATC.\r\nThe aircraft experienced light to moderate turbulence while level at 3000 feet direct to the IAF.  The aircraft was in and out of the bottom of the clouds.  The moderate turbulence subsided when ATC issued a descent to 2000 feet while the aircraft was proceeding direct to the IAF.\r\nWhen descending through 2700 feet for 2000 feet, the aircraft entered VMC conditions.  The crew requested a visual from Approach control.  ATC granted the visual approach and told the crew to contact Tower.\r\nApproach\r\nThe crew did not accomplish the Approach check until 2500 feet after being cleared for the visual to Runway 6.  According to the KC-10 flight manual, this check is normally accomplished after passing 14000 feet.  The crew completed the Approach check after the AC (PF) called for it.\r\nThe crew started to configure at 9 miles and Tower cleared the aircraft to land at 7 miles.\r\nThe visual approach path to Runway 6 is over a hospital that aircraft are supposed to avoid for noise abatement.  The aircraft was level at 2000 feet when approaching the hospital.  The FE reminded the AC (PF) of the noise abatement restriction and the AC (PF) turned to avoid the hospital.  (OUTSTANDING INQUIRY)\r\nThe aircraft was 20 knots above approach speed at 1000 feet and the CP (PNF) failed to make the stabilized approach deviation callout.  The CP (PNF) also failed to make the 1000 and 500 foot stabilized approach callouts.  The AC (PF) had the aircraft stabilized by 500 feet AGL and maintained the criteria through touchdown.  (MARGINAL MONITOR/CROSSCHECK)\r\nLanding    \r\nThe aircraft touched on centerline 1500 feet from the approach end of Runway 6.\r\nTaxi\r\nMaintenance was not in position to marshall the aircraft into its spot when the aircraft arrived at parking.  Local procedures prohibit aircraft from parking without a marshalling team.  The crew did call Command Post 30 minutes prior to landing to confirm their arrival time in accordance with procedures.  After about a 10 minute wait and 2 calls to Command Post from the BO, maintenance arrived and marshalled the aircraft into parking.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachPlansStated","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachRunwayManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"DescentApproachWorkloadManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCaptainLeadership","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallCommunicationEnvironment","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"OverallNarrative","value":"A solid, competent crew that completed the mission safely.

The airline pilot pointed out crew duties were clearly delineated and followed at the airline especially in respect to manipulating the mode control panel.  The pilots pointed out crews frequently disregarded the written procedures for which pilot (PF or PNF) should be manipulating the MCP especially at busy times such as during air refueling other aircraft in the AOR.  For example, if the autopilot is on the PF should be manipulating the MCP but many times the pilots have seen the PNF changing the panel in violation to guidance.  The pilots do not want every aspect of flying \"overproceduralized\" but would like the Flying Training Units to put a heavier emphasis on PF versus PNF duties before one pilots makes a change to the aircraft to which the other pilot is unaware of and not expecting that puts the aircraft in an unsafe position.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"InterviewQuestion2","value":"The AC suggested that command and control, specifically, TACC accomplish their own \"DIMS\" check.  This was his acronym for \"Does it Make Sense.\"  He gave today's mission as one example of many examples.  To recap, TACC wanted the aircraft to fly from ETAR to ETAD to deliver a maintenance part (fire bottle) for a broken C-5.  This is normally a 1 to 1.5 hour drive in a car.  Instead, TACC wanted to dispatch an aircraft that would be above maximum landing weight to an airfield that was forecast to be below landing minimums for 4 to 5 hours after the original takeoff time at a cost of about $20000 an hour.  The crew also had a difficult time believing this item could not be shipped over land as TACC claimed and suspected someone did not want to prepare the part for overland shipping.  According to the crew, this is a very inefficient way of doing business in lieu of AMC's emphasis on fuel savings and unsafe when considering the weather and the overweight landing potential (or need to defuel).

the flight, out at the aircraft the AC queried the MCD (medical crew director) if there were any pressurization issues from a medical standpoint for the flight. The MCD did not have an answer right away but said she would check on it and get back to the AC.\r\nThe AC was obviously thinking in this aspect about fuel and wanted to make sure that if they had to go at a lower altitude to ensure a lower cabin altitude under normal pressurization state, that he would have enough fuel because the flight manager had planned him at flight level 390.\r\nThe AC compared what he actually had on the jet for a fuel load versus what the block 10 of the CFP was and discovered that he had about 10k over the amount on block 10 so he was not overly concerned after that was known if he would be later given info from the MCD that it would be best to avoid the higher cabin altitudes.\r\nIn fact, after about 15 minutes the MCD informed the AC that there were no known patient/medical pressurization issues and that whatever he would have the cabin altitude at would be fine.\r\nIn the blocks during pre flight operations the CP plugged in the wrong way point for one of the points. He plugged in 34 N instead of 35 N.\r\nThis error was completely un-managed in any way, and the result was that another error was made, the procedural error of not doing any of the oceanic CFP documentation or oceanic plotting. (Poor Monitor / Crosscheck) \r\nThis further error and the resulting lateral deviation UAS is captured as another error, and UAS and logged later and explained out fully in the Cruise narrative.\r\nLater, in the middle of the interior inspection checklist, clearance delivery called to say that the clearance was available and the crew should advise them ready to copy.  This was right in the middle of the checklist and would have been quite an interruption.\r\nThe AC in the left seat, advised the CP to tell them to stand by, they would call them back.  He stated to the CP that he didn't want to interrupt the checklist because he thought that was a good way to mess it up.  The CP agreed, and told clearance delivery that they would call them back.\r\nAfter the interior inspection was completed in an excellent manner, with the avoided interruption of picking up clearance in the middle of it, the CP called them back and told them he was ready to copy the clearance. When clearance read the route to the CP there were 3 extra points in the route that had not been filed. The controller read the points by their common full name for the VORs and mixed in the full name of any 5 letter way points (or so the CP and AC thought).\r\nThe CP read back as best he could the extra points in the route and clearance confirmed that was correct after 2 back and forths of miss-pronunciations by the CP.  The real problem here though, arose when the CP and AC tried to make the FMS right for the new route with the extra way-points. The CP and AC tried no less than 8 times to figure out what the points were by guessing they were VORs (requiring a 3 letter input to the FMS) and guessing at the spelling of those that they thought were 5 letter points.  They also used what they could find on enroute charts to help take guesses as what the points actually were.\r\nIn this case ATC really screwed them because they should have spelled out VORs and 5 letter way points. In the no less than 15, yes 15 radio calls back and forth to clearance, the CP and AC discovered that they had been putting a K in front of one of the points just from what they thought they heard from clearance.  They knew they weren't getting the right answers during all this back and forth because the points were not going in the FMS or some of the guesses were showing thousands of miles away.\r\nOne particularly heinous mistake the clearance delivery personnel made was to confirm when the CP asked if a certain point was phonetically (example only) Alpha Bravo Charlie. This meant to the CP and AC that the point to fly to was a VOR. As they eventually got to the right answer by trial and error because the FMS would not take that as a VOR they saw that that was completely wrong information by the clearance delivery personnel, in this particular case, those 3 letters were the first 3 letters of the 5 letter way point and the clearance delivery personnel was just confirming that the crew had the first 3 letters correctly. \r\nThe crew eventually got it built in the box, but it was one of the most painful clearance delivery experiences I have seen.  (Outstanding Inquiry) The AC wisely noted that after it was built it pretty much looked like a straight line more or less in the FMS which seemed logical.\r\nClearance Delivery at an AFB should never use common names for way-points, i.e. when reading a clearance, the O'hare VOR should not be read as O'hare, it should be read as Oscar Romeo Delta, 5 letters even more so should be phonetically spelled out with all five letters, not miss-pronounced and abbreviated by clearance.  If I was stationed at RODN I would have called the ATC supervisor and debriefed him on the very poor performance of the clearance delivery personnel. He used bad technique and incorrectly confirmed wrong read backs.  Eventually the crew completely did not trust him and went with the FMS flight plan because it looked like a straight line.\r\nIf there was a threat for ATC personnel incompetent that is what I would have used.\r\nFor taxi out the crew was given some taxi-ways to use to get to the runway, but not directions to turn on those taxi-ways. Some better study of the airfield diagram would have been very beneficial to them, but the AC confidently stated he knew where to go.  As it played out, he did not. (Marginal Taxiway/Runway Management)\r\nAs the crew approached another part of the ramp the AC said \"okay were making a left up here\"  The CP was not sure, asked if it wasn't right, and relented and basically said that if the AC was sure it was left that he guessed it was.\r\nAs the AC approached the taxiway, he all of a sudden did not feel so confident and stopped the aircraft, and asked the CP to confirm with ground that it was a left. Ground control said negative, a right turn. The AC thanked the CP and turned right. This scared the crew a bit, and the CP really studied the airport diagram now and told the AC exactly which direction he would need to turn to logically lead through the list of taxi-ways they had been given in their clearance to arrive at the runway for takeoff.\r\nDuring the time the crew was pre-flighting through the level off, the mission crew director (MCD) had to talk to the AC on interphone numerous times. This was almost always an interruption to cockpit duties each and every time to the AC and CP. I do not feel it was unprofessional or even necessarily anything that can be cut down on, as the information was often just part of the MCD's requirement, but never the less it is logged as a threat because it was a distraction and interruption to the cockpit crew that is unique to the AE mission.\r\nThe AC and CP were very professional about addressing the MCD and did an excellent job of filtering it out when higher priority cockpit duties were pressing but this was their 5th leg of the AE trip and who knows how many previous AE missions they had flown so my impression is that they were both very much above average in this, and other crews may have suffered more errors induced by this distracting threat.\r\nWhen the aircraft approached the runway, ground control told them to switch to tower. The CP in the right seat forgot to switch the frequency and transmitted on ground to what he thought was tower.\r\nGround control told the CP he was transmitting on ground, the CP realized his error, switched the frequency and transmitted to tower properly.\r\nAs the CP checked in with tower and reported that they were ready for takeoff, tower told them to \"line up and wait\" which is correct verbiage. The CP read back \"taxi into position and hold\" which is incorrect verbiage.\r\nThe AC was right on top of this, and even though ATC did not correct the poor read back of the CP the AC told the CP to tell the tower \"correction, line up and wait.\"  The CP complied with the AC's instructions and corrected his radio call to tower.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartSopBriefing","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartPlansStated","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartContingencyManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Poor","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartWorkloadManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartRunwayManagement","value":"Marginal","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"PreDepartInquiry","value":"Outstanding","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbAutomationManagement","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbEvaluationOfPlans","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbInquiry","value":"Not Observed","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbMonitorCrossCheck","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbNarrative","value":"The AC made an excellent takeoff and departure from runway 5R.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"TakeoffClimbWorkloadManagement","value":"Good","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"CruiseNarrative","value":"TOC - Cruise - TOD Narrative\r\nThe first 2 hours of flight were under radar contact and VHF radio control.\r\nTokyo control is extremely difficult to understand the accent in certain sectors and the CP had trouble understanding the more complicated transmissions like frequency changes.\r\nThe AC helped the CP a lot with the deciphering of the accents and the pilots worked as a good team to manage this threat safely never with anymore than 1 extra transmission to work it out safely.\r\nAfter the first 2 hours the crew coasted out oceanic.\r\nWhile at cruise at 37000 feet, this crew did not follow any of the guidance in the MNPS manual on standardizing CFP documentation for oceanic legs. The only thing they did do was circle the way points during pre-flight. They did not check courses and distances. They did not mark down fuels. They did not write down winds. They did not check points and course distances approaching a way point and document it. They did not plot approximately 10 minutes after each way point.\r\nThey did not detect their error in time to avoid other errors and eventually a UAS and possibly an ATC violation (in the form of an ATC intervention.)\r\nIt played out like this.  Because they did not do any of the required checks during pre-flight they did not catch that the CP had programmed the FMS with a way point at 34 North versus the filed and cleared point at 35 North.  This is a relatively minor error, making an FMS typing mistake, but not employing the tried and true procedures to catch small mistakes like this is an error of large proportion in contrast. So, like the error (separately captured) previously explained it added to but wasn't caused by the CP's typing error. \r\nIt is important to mention that even worse than not using any of the oceanic procedures for catching these mistakes, the AC circled the wrong point (a feeble attempt at the procedures) when it was NOT in fact what was in the FMS.  He either pencil whipped this or did not understand that circling the way point meant the second pilot had checked that it was correctly programmed in to the FMS.\r\nAll these very poor procedural errors in following protocol for oceanic procedures lead to them navigating to the wrong way point in oceanic airspace at 34 N instead of 35 N. They never detected their error of making the procedural error of not checking and so they did not catch the original typing error of the CP of typing in the wrong point.  At some point when they were far enough off course this became a UAS.  \r\nATC CPDLC'd them with a note asking to confirm their next way point was 35 N. They perked up and panic struck as they saw in the FMS they were navigating to 34 N. Once again, the 1801 and the CFP said 35 N but they had programmed 34 N.  They quickly re-programmed the FMS, the jet turned about 20 degrees in heading, and they answered ATC that they were navigating to 35 N now.  This is what is known as an ATC intervention and it is likely that ATC violated them.  In the old days of only HF reporting they may have gotten away with this but as I said I think it is likely they got violated.

Standardization in procedures from taxi to shutdown also cut down of questions of intent.\r\nCP - Overzealous attempts at fuel conservation.  Specifically not being allowed to choose alternates outside of a weather system.  I have been placed in danger because a single wx shop in Spain was calling \"good alternate\" wx when  no one else on the continent was.

AC discovered that the autopilot was written up as inoperative.  The crew understood the system would most likely not work, but preformed the preflight test of the autopilot anyway.  On the ground the autopilot passed the self test and responded correctly to the manual autopilot test.  When the crew attempted to engage the altitude hold shortly after level-off the entire autopilot would kick off.  The crew flew the mission without altitude hold. \r\nThe landing light on the jet was burned out.  The crew chiefs had discovered this problem prior to the crew arriving at the jet.  The crew chiefs worked on the landing light while the crew did the preflight. The crew chiefs were unable to fix the landing light in a reasonable amount of time the crew delayed engine start and missed their takeoff time by 40 minutes.\r\nWhile the crew worked with the crew chiefs to resolve the landing light problem the AC communicated with C2 so receivers would be aware of the delay.\r\nDuring preflight when the CP was copying clearance from Clearance & Delivery, the Crew chief asked the pilots twice to turn on the landing light to test the light which blocked some of the clearance from ATC. The CP failed to copy and read the clearance correctly which required ATC to call back a second time.  Eventually the clearance was properly copied and read back.\r\nThe pilot's airspeed indicator had only one white speed bug. The pilot committed the takeoff speeds to memory and hit all required callouts on the takeoff roll.\r\nDuring the \"Starting engines before taxi\" checklist, the CP skipped checklist item #27: EFAS & SYD SWITCHES - ON, LIGHTS OUT. Skipping the checklist item had left the EFAS FAIL annunciator illuminated for most of the taxi out.  During the Taxi checklist the copilot called \"Annunciators\" on step 13, wherein the AC noticed the EFAS FAIL light illuminated and engaged the EFAS and SYD switches.\r\nThe crew taxied cautiously at the unfamiliar airport and backed up all taxi instructions with the the airport diagram.  \r\nDuring taxi out the green EXT PWR AVAL light on the overhead panel was illuminated.  The Boom operator noticed the light and brought it to the attention of the crew.  The CP reached up and closed the guard for the external power switch and it extinguished the light.  No other discussion about the system or light followed. \r\nDuring taxi out while performing the TAXI checklist, the CP called step #13 ANNUNCIATORS and failed to look at the Pilot's side annunciators before calling \"Checked\".  No crew member realized the CP had not noticed the pilot side annunciators.  The AC noticed the EFAS FAIL light illuminated and engaged the EFAS and SYD switches. The switches and system were in the proper position for takeoff and flight.\r\nOn taxi out the crew utilized a taxiway where an aircraft was parked with engines running adjacent to the taxiway and the marshaller was located on the other side of the taxiway forcing the KC-135 to taxi between the parked jet and the marshaller.  As they taxied by the Marshaller who was standing within engine inlet airflow radius and within 25 feet of engine number 4.  The marshaller realized the hazardous position he was in and quickly backed away from the KC-135 as it taxied past.  The crew acknowledged the marshaller standing close but failed to hold position, instead they taxied with the marshaller precariously close to the #4 engine. \r\nThe crew taxied to and held short of runway 03R.

The AC (PNF) made several calls in the blind and told ATC he was switching to a VHF frequency.  Prior to making a change to the VHF frequency Approach told them to switch to another departure controller.  The new controller on UHF was again unreadable.  They found the VHF frequency and good communications were finally restored passing 14,000 feet. \r\nDuring the climb from 3000 to 14,000 when the crew was having communication difficulties, the CP (PF) was verbally calling out what he was doing and being extra cognisant of speeds knowing that the AC (PNF) was task saturated trying to figure out the communication problems forcing him to do limited cross check and monitor. \r\n(Monitor/Crosscheck:  Marginal)\r\nThe AC (PNF) called transition altitude and the crew made the change to 29.92.

The crew failed to query the controller and assumed they were to fly the ILS then side step to the right runway.  As they were handed off to tower, the same clearance was given, the crew responded by telling tower they were visual with runway 21R and wanted to be cleared for the visual approach.

They noticed now because the aircraft landing gear warning horn came on in a mode that can not be silenced.  They also would have probably noticed anyway, because the Before Landing Checklist would have directed \"Down 4 green\" from all 3 of them.\r\nThey quickly accessed that they had the good indication on the FE panel.  They were unsure if they had to run a checklist (they do not, the flight manual states that a good indication on either panel means the gear is good).  They went quickly back and forth with what to do, just continue and land with the very annoying landing gear warning horn on, or discontinue the approach and trouble shoot. \r\nThey chose to discontinue the approach and trouble shoot, reference the flight manual.  They did not execute a formal go-around so there were no distinct errors but the CP was not sure what to do with the aircraft.  The AC got a clearance from ATC for a vector and a climb.  The CP was unclear what to do, he  tried to ask for climb N1 and started climbing with vert speed, and the AC realized they were all off any normal profile and suggested they retract the flaps and slats as they speeded up in a climb N1/vert speed combination which was obviously resulting in an airspeed increase in the climb.  There were no specific errors or flight manual violations but it was not an efficient or  well flown jet for a time period.  \r\nThe AC asked the FE to look for any checklist (none apply since they had good indications on the FE panel, not both). With the lack of any other guidance, they decided to recycle the gear which resulted eventually in the same indications up front (bad center gear) and on the FE panel (four green). The AC decided to let the CP fly the approach but had figured out that he was just going to have to land with the warning horn going off. He briefed the crew that they would put the flaps down at 1000 feet AGL to minimize the time spent with the horn blaring. They landed with no further problems.  In addition, added difficulty was dealt with during all of this because ATC sent them to a holding fix after the initial vector which increased work load for the pilots.  They never actually got to the fix and held because they had sorted through the problem and requested vectors for the approach prior to reaching the fix.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatPhaseOfFlight","value":"Approach","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatAltitude","value":"2500","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatType","value":"Ops - Aircraft","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatCode","value":"Aircraft malfunction unexpected by crew","parentValue":"Ops - Aircraft","code":null},{"key":"ThreatOutcome","value":"Inconsequential","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatCrewResponse","value":"Pop-up Threat / Anticipation Not Possible","parentValue":null,"code":null}]},{"observationId":"8fae8160-f94f-41c2-96de-5bf46f0bb0db","observationNumber":8,"narrativeGroupKey":"TaxiPark","id":"8899cc88-ab63-4525-a94b-03588c931645","number":12,"dataPoints":[{"key":"ThreatObservationNumber","value":"8","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatNumber","value":"12","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatDescription","value":"During taxi in, the TA marshaller gave exact opposite instructions initially.

They determined that although it was flight planned at 240 B 260 without the ALTRV, they could probably do it as low as 17000 feet if required. They realized that they could really only get accurate guesses at fuel burn for themselves and so they passed their concern about fuel without the ALTRV to the DCO to determine his inputs with regard to F15 fuel burn at a lower altitude.\r\nThe DCO said that the fighters could make it at 17000 feet if ATC could only fit them with multiple altitudes lower. He also stated that he had coordinated with ATC and he thought that their would not be any airspace issues, even without the ALTRV.\r\nLater, during the flight, they did in fact get the altitudes they needed, only having to compress the block on one occasion to 2 altitudes instead of 3 with the Japanese sector. Once past that initial sector it was expanded again, and this is probably what would have been the case even if they had an approved ALTRV.

ATC read back \"altimeter XXXX and affirm sir, 6000 feet but you can keep it as a pilot discretion if you like\"\r\nThis would explain why ATC did not correct the CP when he didn't read back the 6000 feet initially, if ATC thought maybe the CP was contemplating if it was PD or not, since he had previously been on a PD to 16000.  That was not the case, the CP purely just failed to read back the altitude clearance, but ATC and the AC did the right thing in assuring the clearance did get passed back and forth correctly.\r\n","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorPhaseOfFlight","value":"Descent to IAF / VFR Pattern Entry ","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorAltitude","value":"22000","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatLink","value":null,"parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorType","value":"Comm - Cockpit Crew-to-External ","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorCode","value":"Wrong readback/callback to ATC","parentValue":"Comm - Cockpit Crew-to-External ","code":null},{"key":"ErrorOutcome","value":"Inconsequential","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorCrewResponse","value":"Detected / Acted Upon to Correct","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASResponse","value":"No UAS","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASDetected","value":"AC","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASOutcome","value":"No UAS","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUndesiredAircraftStateType","value":"No UAS","parentValue":null,"code":null}]},{"threatLinkId":null,"observationId":"b388746d-ef7f-4349-8457-f1d465517e2e","observationNumber":231,"narrativeGroupKey":"Predeparture","id":"e9a76c84-7798-4e5a-a4a8-a82fcfb107b6","number":0,"dataPoints":[{"key":"ErrorObservationNumber","value":"231","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorDescription","value":"When the CP called Tower for push back clearance, the Tower cleared the aircraft to start engines.

In summary of this situation, the original typing error by the CP resulting in the protocol error by AC and CP resulted in the UAS detected by ATC.","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorPhaseOfFlight","value":"Cruise to TOD","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorAltitude","value":"37000","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ThreatLink","value":null,"parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorType","value":"Procedural - Other Procedural","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorCode","value":"z - INTENT ‐ Omitted oceanic procedures","parentValue":"Procedural - Other Procedural","code":null},{"key":"ErrorOutcome","value":"Undesired Aircraft State","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorCrewResponse","value":"Ignored (Detected / Not Acted Upon)","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASResponse","value":"Detected with Action","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASDetected","value":"All Crew Members Together","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUASOutcome","value":"Inconsequential","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorUndesiredAircraftStateType","value":"Lateral deviation","parentValue":null,"code":null}]},{"threatLinkId":null,"observationId":"c24533d0-e5c3-44b4-ab4d-779872b69dec","observationNumber":238,"narrativeGroupKey":"Predeparture","id":"0ff65119-3d3f-44d1-b5f2-5f7ebb1d78bf","number":0,"dataPoints":[{"key":"ErrorObservationNumber","value":"238","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorDescription","value":"Failure to cross verify FMS - Missed  wrong way point (34 N instead of 35 N)","parentValue":null,"code":null},{"key":"ErrorManagement","value":"Linked to additional error during Cruise - While at cruise at 37000 feet, this crew did not follow any of the guidance in the MNPS manual on standardizing CFP documentation for oceanic legs.
